A professor of surgery was giving a lecture on ‘burn’ in an undergraduate medical class. He started with the definition of ‘burn’ using a PowerPoint slide. The students near the back of the class seemed uninterested in the topic and were gossiping. The professor tried to attract their attention, but it created uproar in the class itself. To calm the class, he used a blank slide and asked the class to volunteer in defining ‘burn’. It brought a complete silence. Perplexed, he went to his next slide that showed a burning Rohingya village in Myanmar.\r\n\r\nAnswer the following questions considering the above scenario:                             4+4+4+(2+4)=18\r\ni) Was there anything wrong with showing the definition of the slide? Explain.\r\nii) If you are asked to run the class, how would you plan to begin?\r\niii) How could the professor have dealt with the situation at the back of the class?\r\niv) Was showing the burning village OK? Justify your comment, \r\n        and outline how you would like to use a photograph in such a class.\r\n\r\n2.

', '<div xss=removed>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><span xss=removed>Asia has about\r\n25% of the world\'s population. One-fifth of the mentally ill in the world live\r\nin this region but mental-health manpower is grossly inadequate</span><span xss=removed>. Most of the patient’s first contact is the\r\nprimary care physician for treatment. Unfortunately due to a deficient training\r\nat the undergraduate level, most doctors are unable to recognize and correctly\r\ntreat psychiatric disorders. The basic purpose of teaching and training at the\r\nundergraduate level is to prepare medical graduates to serve better at primary\r\nhealth-care level. The patients with physical illness have concomitant\r\nemotional problems requiring professional handling; therefore, teaching of\r\nPsychiatry at the undergraduate level becomes even more relevant and essential</span><span xss=removed>. </span><span xss=removed>Emphasis on teaching & training in\r\nPsychiatry in undergraduate curriculum is low. In many of the colleges the\r\ndepartment of Psychiatry has come into existence recently, and the faculty\r\nteaching the undergraduates is relatively junior and not fully experienced in\r\nteaching undergraduate.</span><u><span xss=removed><o></o></span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><span xss=removed>Bangladesh Medical & Dental Council (BMDC) is following the\r\ncurriculum at present that have been formed in the year 2012. If we discuss\r\nBMDC curriculum including the points stated in Davidoff 1996 model, it’s a good\r\none stating the objectives. One of the objects should be having clear knowledge\r\nabout medico legal problems regarding psychiatry and dealing effectively with\r\nchallenging patient’s weather mentally ill or not. Medico legal aspect of\r\npsychiatry should be included in content as mental health act is on the\r\nprocesses of publishing in Bangladesh. However this ongoing curriculum is a\r\ngood one regarding integrity of clinical and preclinical subject. Medical\r\nstudents are now having clinical subject classes from 2<sup>nd</sup> phase that\r\nis after first one and a half year. They get placement in clinical class of\r\nPsychiatry department for 3 weeks in 3<sup>rd</sup> phase. Another 1 or 2 weeks\r\nshould be added in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> phase which will increase\r\ntheir interest and skills to deal with mentally ill patients as well as\r\nchallenging patients or relatives or friends of the patients in some emergency\r\nsituations. Options can be Field trip or Tertiary care hospital/ De addiction clinic\r\nvisit in the 2<sup>nd</sup> phase instead of ward placement. We can add some\r\nshort scales to measure anxiety, depression and MMSE as teaching aids. Time\r\nallocated for lecture is 20 hours. Instead of lecture, or reducing the time of\r\nlectures we can adopt more Student centered, Problem based, integrated method\r\nwhich will include all the points of SPICES model and Spiral curriculum. After\r\na short discussion with my students and from my personal experience I have\r\nfound that learning by doing is the best option. We can assign 10 cases of\r\nmental illness per student from phase 2 onward for taking care as a whole and\r\nmaintaining liaisons with other departments as needed. There will be small\r\nexams in every 6 months and during the final exam they will present the cases\r\nas a follow up study. One supervisor Psychiatrist will be guide all through and\r\nthus they can learn by themselves and with interest. In assessment part my\r\nsuggestion is that one Psychiatrist must be present in a board of final exam. A\r\nformer Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang has wisely stated that “ I believe that\r\nteaching without testing is like cooking without testing”. Learning outcomes\r\ncan be measured by attitude of students towards psychiatry just after admission\r\nto medical college and after final exam. Many studies have shown that proper\r\nexposure to Psychiatry changes the attitude of student towards positive.</span><span xss=removed> </span><span xss=removed>Tharyan <i>et al.,</i> in their study, observed that exposure\r\nto psychiatry training did have an influence on the change in attitude to\r\nmental illness, though it did not influence the choice of career. Rao <i>et\r\nal.</i> did a prospective study to elicit and monitor over time the medical\r\nstudents\' attitudes to psychiatry, psychiatrists, psychiatric patients and\r\ntheir treatment. There was a significant shift in favorable direction in the\r\ngeneral attitude to psychiatry, both before and after training. Majority of\r\nthem considered psychiatric specialty as challenging and scientific, and almost\r\nall felt that too little time is being spent on psychiatry in UG curriculum.\r\nHowever regarding educational environment, Psychiatry departments in all\r\nmedical colleges should be strengthened with a minimum strength of 20 beds and\r\na minimum faculty consisting of one professor, one associate professor and two\r\nasst. professors/lecturers.<o></o></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><span xss=removed>Psychiatry curriculum has obvious gap in the declared and taught part\r\nthat can be rectified only if policy and decision makers recognize the\r\nimportance of Psychiatry, not only in medical education but also in primary\r\nhealth care. The basic problem is that students can feel and empathize for the\r\nphysically ill, but they are overwhelmed by fear when they see the mentally ill.\r\nThe objective of undergraduate psychiatric education should be to equip medical\r\nstudents with core psychiatric knowledge useful in daily medical practice\r\nrather than filling curriculum time. Students are overloaded with brain\r\nchemistry, neurotransmitters research data on psychoses but are starved of\r\nrecognition of anxiety states, depression in non-psychiatric medical settings. Primary-care\r\npsychiatric problems, anxiety, depression are in abundance in primary-care\r\nclinics and medical wards where Psychiatry is to be taught in MBBS level. The\r\nundergraduates may be taught the psychiatric manifestations of common physical\r\ndisorders like delirium, which is found in abundance in medical and surgical\r\nwards. In most of the medical colleges of this region, knowledge of psychiatric\r\nillnesses is not evaluated in the examinations, psychiatric cases are not kept\r\nin clinical examination and viva voce part also seldom covers Psychiatry. Long-term\r\nplans should focus on reforming undergraduate medical education to incorporate\r\nexpanded, structured training in Psychiatry so that M.B.B.S. doctors are well\r\nprepared for the high standards of postgraduate training and examinations. The\r\nfuture doctor should be sympathetic towards patients with psychological\r\ncomplaints, be able to detect mental disorders and treat simple cases and be\r\naware when to seek a specialist\'s help. <o></o></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><span xss=removed><o> </o></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><span xss=removed>References-<o></o></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div><div xss=removed>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" xss=removed>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;<span xss=removed>1.<span xss=removed>    </span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<span xss=removed>Trivedi JK, Goel D, Kallivaylil RA, Isaac M,\r\nShrestha DM, Gambheera HC.

class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed>Ways of improvement and implementation of\r\n     suggestions for further development</li></ol>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Introduction:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Curriculum is the blueprint that entails the goals of any\r\neducational activity and endeavor to achieve the goal. It is known that ten\r\nbasic questions need to be considered before planning the curriculum and there\r\nremain five aspects of a curriculum. There should be a core and electives.\r\nDepending up on these basic facts in curriculum, the existing MBBS curriculum is\r\nevaluated and an attempt is made to further improve it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Given/current\r\ncurriculum:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the 2012 curriculum, in urinary system there remain five\r\ntopics namely glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury,\r\nchronic kidney disease and urinary tract infection and the set learning objectives\r\nare there. Integrated teaching included rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis and\r\nnephrotic syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Overall\r\nstrength:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC) is having a\r\ncurriculum with its defined learning objectives. May it not be flaw-less, but\r\nits presence and practice is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now the evaluation of nephrology part in detail is presented.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Need assessment:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The current curriculum is sufficiently justified in\r\nfulfilling the community needs. It encompassed the common renal diseases\r\nidentifiable in community that may be treated in primary care and some patients\r\nwill require secondary and tertiary care level services. Still there should be\r\na room for further improvements in need assessment especially by critical\r\nincident studies for example star fruit (kamranga) can cause acute kidney\r\ninjury. So, it might be included in future that common edible agents with\r\nnephrotoxic potentials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Aims and\r\nobjectives:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the existing curriculum, the objectives are clearly\r\nmentioned. So, there is very little, if any, to improve in this area, rather to\r\nme, there remain some areas of specialists’ concern like arterio-venous\r\nfistula, renal allografts etc. which, probably might not be in core rather\r\nshould be in electives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Contents:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The contents of existing curriculum included acute kidney\r\ninjury, chronic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome and\r\nurinary tract infection. These broad areas of renal diseases are quiet\r\nsufficient to address the community needs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Organization\r\nof contents:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Because of the vertical organization of current curriculum,\r\nclinically relevant basic subjects are incorporated in first two academic\r\nyears, then in fourth year students are to learn para-clinical subjects. If a\r\nhorizontal integration could be made especially in to topics like\r\npost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections to involve\r\nmedicine, nephrology, paediatrics, patology, microbiology, pharmacology,\r\ncommunity medicine in integrated teaching, definitely it could achieve a better\r\nlearning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Educational\r\nstrategies:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Regarding the educational strategies, there is very little\r\nin writing. This appears to be of discipline based and opportunistic. If\r\ndirection is given towards problem based and integrated, then it would be\r\nbetter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Teaching\r\nmethods to be used: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little is known from the existing, 2012 undergraduate\r\nmedical curriculum, regarding use of teaching methods. If broad areas of\r\nnephrology in this curriculum are to be evaluated, all 5 topics are for large\r\ngroup teaching especially lectures (5 hours). So, definitely power-point\r\npresentation is to be used. If we consider the learning objectives, then small\r\ngroup teaching at bed side by demonstrating the real patient would result in\r\nbetter learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Assessment:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Very little is extracted from the current curriculum\r\nregarding assessment in nephrology except one Item in card 1. If a clear\r\ndistribution in assessment might be made like topics to be covered in bed side clinical\r\nexamination for example nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and theory\r\nlike anaemia management of chronic kidney disease etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Communication\r\nof the curriculum:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is an existing curriculum but is poorly communicated\r\nto all (if any) clinical teachers and students of respective course. It is\r\nprobably because of ignorance of the presence of curriculum by many clinical\r\nteachers. Many clinical staffs do not know how much is to teach to a 3<sup>rd</sup>\r\nyear clinical placement or a 5<sup>th</sup> year clinical placement. Students\r\ndo not know the existence of the curriculum. So, this communication should be\r\nemphasized for both teachers and students to attain a better learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Educational\r\nenvironment:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In resource-constrain setting like ours, the appropriate\r\nattainment of an appropriate educational environment is often impossible. During\r\na bedside teaching, it is almost impossible to create a calm environment. It is\r\nquiet impossible to give proper attention to 24-30 students, or supervise or\r\nteach examination techniques/skills to all students in a single 2 hour clinical\r\nclass. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Management\r\nof the overall process:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the light of five basic aspects of curriculum namely\r\naims, content, organization of contents, learning methods and assessment, the\r\n2012 undergraduate medical curriculum encompassing nephrology addressed almost\r\nall areas. But, there are weaknesses in descriptions of learning methods to be\r\nused for given tasks and ways of assessment. A better description in these\r\nareas is likely to bring about an expected learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Conclusion:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Curriculum is a dynamic theme. Always there remains a scope\r\nfor improvement. The overall weakness of the curriculum is the inadequacy in given\r\ntime for development of communication skills, lack of evaluation and feedback\r\nby the students regarding the course and teachers. For implementation of the newly\r\n(in this assignment) proposed activities, a subject committee may be formed to\r\nidentify areas for further improvement. These proposals might be communicated\r\nwith the medicine department and phase 3 meetings. Ultimately at national level,\r\nduring curriculum development, these issues should be raised and incorporated (if\r\nfound logical by arguments) in undergraduate medical curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-19 12:49:04', 'upload/attachment/29c9d51121409bca4e7335a7b3f5f558.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Introduction:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Curriculum refers to a series of planned activities intended\r\nto bring about specific learning outcomes in the student. There are ten basic\r\nquestions are considered before planning a curriculum and there remain five\r\naspects of a curriculum. Depending up on these basic facts in curriculum the\r\nexisting MBBS curriculum is evaluated and an attempt is made to improve it.<span xss=removed></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Given/current\r\ncurriculum:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the 2012 curriculum, in urinary system there remain five\r\ntopics namely glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury,\r\nchronic kidney disease and urinary tract infection. And the set learning objectives\r\nare there. Integrated teaching included rheumatic fever and nephrotic syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Overall\r\nstrength:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council have a curriculum with\r\nits defined learning objectives. May it not be flaw free, but its presence and\r\npractice is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now the evaluation Nephrology part in detail is presented. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Need\r\nassessment:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The current curriculum is sufficiently justified in\r\nfulfilling the community needs. It encompassed the common renal diseases\r\nidentifiable in community that may be treated in primary care and some patients\r\nwill require secondary and tertiary care level services. Still there should be\r\na room for further improvements in need assessment especially by critical\r\nincident studies for example star fruit can cause acute kidney injury. So, it\r\nmight be included in future that common edible agents with nephrotoxic\r\npotentials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Aims and\r\nobjectives:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the existing curriculum, the objectives are clearly\r\nmentioned. So, there is very little, if any, to improve in this area, rather to\r\nme, there remain some areas of specialists’ concern like arterio-venous\r\nfistula, renal allografts etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Contents:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The contents of existing curriculum included AKI, CKD,\r\nglomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome and urinary tract infection. These broad\r\nareas of renal diseases are quiet sufficient to address the community needs.\r\nEmerging diseases are to be emphasis in future. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Organization\r\nof contents:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Because of the vertical organization of current curriculum,\r\nclinically relevant basic subjects are incorporated in first two academic\r\nyears, and then in fourth year students are to learn Para clinical subjects. If\r\na horizontal integration could be made especially in to topics like\r\npost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections to involve\r\nmedicine, nephrology, pediatrics, pathology, microbiology, pharmacology,\r\ncommunity medicine in integrated teaching, definitely it could achieve a better\r\nlearning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Educational\r\nstrategies:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This appears to be of discipline based. If direction is\r\ngiven towards problem based and integrated, then it would be better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Teaching\r\nmethods to be used: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the present curriculum 5 hours are allocated to cover\r\nmajor parts of nephrology related topics. It will be more helpful to the\r\nstudent if it is problem solving and improvement in communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Assessment:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Very little is extracted from the current curriculum\r\nregarding assessment in nephrology except one Item in card 1. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Communication\r\nof the curriculum:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is an existing curriculum but is not communicated at\r\nall (if any) to clinical teachers and students of respective course. It is\r\nprobably because of ignorance of the presence of curriculum by many clinical\r\nteachers. Many clinical staffs do not know how much is to teach to a 3<sup>rd</sup>\r\nyear clinical placement or a 5<sup>th</sup> year clinical placement. Students\r\ndo not know the existence of the curriculum. So, this communication should be\r\nemphasized for both teachers and student to attain a better learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Educational\r\nenvironment:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In resource-constrain setting like ours the appropriate\r\nattainment of an appropriate educational environment is often impossible. During\r\na bedside teaching, it is almost impossible to create a calm environment. It is\r\nquiet impossible to give proper attention to 24 students, or supervise or teach\r\nexamination technique to all student in a single 2 hour class. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Management\r\nof the overall process:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the light of five basic aspects of curriculum namely\r\naims, content, organization of contents, learning methods and assessment, the\r\n2012 undergraduate medical curriculum encompassing nephrology addresses almost\r\nall areas. But, there are weaknesses in descriptions of learning methods to be\r\nused for given tasks and ways of assessment. A better description in these\r\nareas is likely to bring about an expected learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span xss=removed>Conclusion:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Overall weakness of the curriculum is the inadequacy in\r\ngiven time for development of communication skills, lack of evaluation and feedback\r\nby the students regarding the course and teachers. For implementation of the\r\nproposed activities, a subject committee may be formed to identify areas for\r\nfurther improvement. These proposals might be communicated with the medicine\r\ndepartment and phase 3 meetings. Ultimately at national level during curriculum\r\ndevelopment these issues should be raised and incorporated in undergraduate\r\nmedical curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-19 01:16:28', 'upload/attachment/fdad3205523624b7683b3e9a9dc36ac0.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

It was a\r\ngeneral opinion of faculty members that students should learn about the\r\nabnormalities in clinical biochemistry. Short case histories followed by\r\nformulation of relevant investigations, interpretations of laboratory results,\r\ndiagnosis of disease and various metabolisms involved were suggested as\r\nadditions to the practical biochemistry curriculum.

And the number of\r\nstudents in each lecture class vary from medical college to college that is\r\nfrom Govt.Medical college to private medical college .On an average there is\r\nmore than hundred students in a lecture class. As a result, it is not possible\r\nfor a teacher to achieve better interaction with the students to reach the\r\ndesired teaching goals. The students also lose concentration and become tired\r\nof the teaching method .In that case my suggestion is to increase the tutorial\r\nhours where small group teaching is obtained and the teacher and the students\r\nhave close contact with each other.

Various aspects and specialties of Surgery are included in the “curriculum for undergraduate medical Education in Bangladesh--updated 2012”, approved by Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BM & DC). </p><p><br></p><p>STRENGTHS OF THE CURRICULUM</p><p>GOAL, AIMS &OBJECTIVES</p><p>At the beginning of main curriculum National goal and objectives of MBBS course, learning out comes/ competences of fresh graduates are described comprehensively. These descriptions of goal, objectives are equally applicable to all clinical subjects including surgery and allied subjects. These descriptions give a clear idea to teachers, students and other stake holders, of the need, goal, purpose, objectives and competences of our medical graduates who will undergo successfully through this curriculum to become a graduate (MBBS) doctor. The curriculum is based on traditional method in sequential manner, not integrated.</p><p>Curriculum of surgery is discipline based. Departmental objectives of surgery department are out lined at the beginning of surgery and Allied Subjects chapter of the curriculum. In departmental objectives of surgery discipline the aim of leaning surgery on the basis of need is outlined. A list of competences/abilities to perform certain tasks (physical, verbal, communication, thinking, manipulative) is short listed under the headings of clinical, communication, Managerial and Manipulative and Practical skills.</p><p>Departmental objectives are good guidelines for teachers and concerned persons to conduct the teaching – learning programme to students with a definite aim.   </p><p>A guideline of teaching learning methods, teaching aids, in course (formative) assessment procedures are mentioned in tabular from. Equipments and appliances necessary to demonstrate and teach the students surgery and allied subjects are comprehensively listed, which is of great help to the department to collect and keep the things ready for demonstration. </p><p>Course contents and learning objectives are given in details. Course contents are divided in to different systems of surgery and allied subjects .Contents are divided in to core and additional according to priority of learning objectives. Contents are distributed at various phases (year) of study in stepwise from basic to advanced. Duration/ time is allocated for different topics of course contents, which help the department and the concerned teachers to plan the lessons (lesson-plan). In learning objectives against each system or topic, what a student should be able to know, state, perform, are mentioned clearly. This part of curriculum is of great help to student to know, what to learn, and to teachers what and how to teach.</p><p>CONTENTS AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT</p><p>Class performance record cards are prescribed for clinical (bed-side teaching), practical and tutorial teaching-learning .Under each heading several relevant topics are listed in the card for teaching learning.</p><p>Different cards are to be learned in different phases (year) of study from basic to advance level of learning. After teaching and learning a topic there is assessment/evaluation, the result of which is noted in a box against the name of the topic. On completion/end of the card it is easily can be seen whether all the topics are covered and the overall performance of the student. There is provision for final/card completion examination and to note down the result in the card, with attendance of the student. This is as established and well coordinated method of formative assessment.</p><p><br></p><p>Though the curriculum is not based on integrated method, but integrated teaching is included only for few common topics. Topics of integrated teaching are listed and instructed to schedule once in a month involving as many as possible specialties. This type of teaching definitely increases the interest of student in learning the subject.</p><p>A mixed educational strategies are adopted in this curriculum.</p><p>A summary in tabular form of the duration of lectures demonstrations, tutorials, clinical/ bed side teaching in  various phases (year of study period) of various specialties of surgery and allied along with time allotted for block posting, formative exam and summative exam is given for at a glance review of the whole curriculum which helps the department to prepare an academic calendar.</p><p>SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT METHODS AND PROCEDURES</p><p>At the end of the curriculum, different aspects and methods of summative assessment (final professional examination) of surgery are outlined. Assessment is an essential part of curriculum, without mentioning the assessment method a curriculum remains incomplete. The results of assessment in terms of different grades of marks are well mentioned.  How the assessment is performed both teacher and student should know thoroughly. In this chapter it is well described. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>WEAKNESS OF THE CURRICULUM</p><p>This curriculum is based on traditional method and discipline based.  In classical traditional method students start learning surgery after finishing the learning of subjects of basic science(anatomy, physiology, biochemistry) and applied science (pathology, microbiology, pharmacology). But in this curriculum students start learning clinical subjects like surgery and medicine after finishing the course of anatomy, physiology and biochemistry in Phase -II. Pathology, microbiology and Pharmacology are taught in phase-III one year after starting the clinical subjects. Without a basic knowledge of these subjects teaching – learning of surgery is difficult. In Phase –II forensic medicine and community medicine are included, to learn these subjects knowledge of  pathology, microbiology and pharmacology is also essential. In this curriculum sequence of learning is not well maintained.</p><p>Topics mentioned in surgery curriculum is wide open and no limitation of knowledge is demarcated, as result the teachers may not be able to limit their knowledge dissemination, and information overload occurs frequently. So topics should be made more specified regarding the limit and depth of knowledge.</p><p>In the curriculum there are some discrepancies in teaching hours. </p><p><br></p><p>To improve and implement the curriculum of surgery at the institutional level, the following points are to be considered actively:</p><p><br></p><p>1.<span xss=removed> </span>All the teachers of the surgery and allied subjects should have knowledge about the curriculum, particularly regarding related subject of the concerned teacher. To disseminate the knowledge of the curriculum and an action plan to set, a departmental workshop can be arranged at the beginning of each session. </p><p>2.<span xss=removed> </span>To follow the quality assurance scheme designed by Centre for Medical Education is a prescribed way to monitor the curriculum implementation in an institute.  </p><p><br></p><p>COMMUNICATIONS OF CURRICULUM</p><p>3.<span xss=removed> </span>Students should be well informed regarding the curriculum in brief including formative and summative assessment methods and procedures, so that they can participate and contribute by periodical feedback of the progress and any difficulty they face.</p><p>4.<span xss=removed> </span>An academic calendar of the department for each batch/session of students should be prepared well ahead of starting the class.</p><p>5.<span xss=removed> </span>A study guide with a list of learning resources and list of standard text books suggested by faculty members should be handed over to students for study at the beginning of session.</p><p><br></p><p>TEACHING METHODS</p><p>6.<span xss=removed> </span>Lectures are to be interactive.</p><p>7.<span xss=removed> </span>A lesson plan for lecture class to be prepared with an idea to avoid information overload.</p><p>8.<span xss=removed> </span>Small group teachings are to be included in the class routine for more interactive discussion.</p><p>9.<span xss=removed> </span>Integrated teaching is to be arranged as per schedule and on the topic prescribed in the curriculum.</p><p>10.<span xss=removed> </span> Pathology, Microbiology and Pharmacology are not included in Phase –II, but clinical subject surgery classes start in Phase-II. It is difficult to continue teaching –learning programme of surgery without some basic knowledge of Pathology, Microbiology and Pharmacology. So arrangement should be made for some classes of the mentioned subjects in class routine of Phase-II, in consultation with heads of the mentioned department of the subjects to facilitate the teaching –learning programme.</p><p><br></p><p>ASSESSMENT</p><p>11.<span xss=removed> </span>Prescribed periodic formative assessment should be arranged and conducted as per schedule, and the results are to be announced for feedback of performance of students and as well as evaluation of teaching performance.</p><p>12.<span xss=removed> </span>A rehearsal of summative assessment should be arranged to familiar the students with the methods of  summative assessment at the end of the course.</p><p><br></p><p>REVIEW AND FEEDBACK</p><p>13.<span xss=removed> </span>All the teachers of the department should meet once in a month on a fixed date to discuss the progress, problems, and find out the solution and any correction in schedule.</p><p>14.<span xss=removed> </span>Members of the faculty will provide in writing the difficulties or deficiencies they face during conducting the course in curriculum to head of the faculty time to time. Head of the faculty will compile them and report it to appropriate authority or present in forums of national curriculum development.</p><p>A.E.MD.ABDUL WASEY</p><div><br></div>', '2018-01-23 06:28:57', NULL, '<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Positive:<o></o></b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Timely submitted<o></o></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Properly submitted<o></o></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The introduction with the statement of basic understanding\r\nabout the curriculum is appropriately written.<o></o></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most of the components of a curriculum is touched.<o></o></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Challenges:<o></o></b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Volume:  Expected in 800\r\nwords.

The\r\ncontents are well documented and well organized. The starting is as traditional\r\nmedical curriculum while basic sciences are taught for one and a half year in\r\nphase I, whereas, spirally integrated in subsequent phases (II, III, and IV) so\r\nthat competence of the students increases with each visit to a topic. The\r\nstrategy adopted in this curriculum is a mixture of approaches both innovative\r\n(SPICES) and traditional. Teaching methods are logically arranged including\r\nlectures, tutorials, practical, demonstrations, clinical and bed-side teaching.\r\nIt also included integrated teaching for twenty hours in each course.\r\nManipulative and practical skills are precisely listed which covers most of the\r\nrequirements in surgical patient management. Small group teaching included\r\ntutorials, problem-based learning, clinical demonstrations (OPD/Indoor), attending\r\nand observing minor operations, demonstrations of X-rays and specimens,\r\nobservation in ICU and post-operative ward, case presentation and discussions.\r\nThere are provision of assignments and scope of self-study. Traditional and\r\nmodern teaching aids are suggested to use namely chalk & board, OHP,\r\nspecimens, plain & contrast X-rays of various systems, ultrasonograph,\r\nisotope scan, CT scan, MRI, computer, multimedia, photographs and videos,\r\nmodels etc. Assessment portion is also well organized namely item examination,\r\ncard final and term examination, final examination (written, oral, practical,\r\nclinical). The whole syllabus is organized with a precise time-table in each\r\nacademic calendar. This curriculum also included the topic those were not\r\naddressed in the previous one like communication skills, professional attitude\r\nand understanding of ethical principles, preventive and palliative care etc. <o></o></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><b><span xss=removed>Limitations:  <o></o></span></b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><span xss=removed>The\r\nsurgical needs in our community is not outlined, instead, a vague term “common\r\nsurgical problems” was used which remains on the discretions of the faculties,\r\nhence, very much subjective one. I think the term “common” must be precisely\r\ndefined and specified, otherwise, a common problem to one may seem to be rare\r\nto another faculty. For example, Cystic Hygroma though rare in our country get\r\nmuch importance in teaching and examination while infective problems other than\r\nabscess including surgical site infections get least importance. A study of\r\nerrors and critical incidence studies are neglected in the contents. To give\r\nimportance to a wide range of allied subjects, the contents are overcrowded\r\ncreating burden to the students and compel to surface learning. Much time is\r\nallocated for lectures (five hundred and twenty hours) while only sixty-two hours\r\nfor clinical/bed-side teaching. This makes theoretical giant and practical\r\ndwarf doctors.  Educational environment\r\nis detailed but practically this environment is very difficult to achieve and\r\nmaintain without supervision so there are great variations of educational\r\nenvironment among medical colleges. Moreover, there is no guideline regarding\r\ntutorial rooms, wards, and patient-student ratio. That is why students of a\r\nlarge number of medical colleges have poor clinical and practical exposure. The\r\ncurriculum management portion is also much neglected. There is no guideline to\r\nstaff requirements, teacher-student ratio and staff development program. So,\r\nthough the curriculum is new teachers remained traditional and inadequate.\r\nLogistical support requirements are not defined and there are great variations\r\namong institutions. Thus, questions adopted in examinations lack variations,\r\npractically most of the questions are set from questions bank. Evaluation\r\nsystem is theoretically upgraded but difficult to implement in most\r\ninstitutions because of inadequate teaching and support staffs. Marks in\r\nformative assessment is very small and subjective. This discourages students’\r\nday to day learning. There is nothing about academic standards and quality\r\nassurance in this curriculum. So, there are gaps among the declared curriculum,\r\ntaught curriculum and learned curriculum. <o></o></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><b><span xss=removed>Conclusions:<o></o></span></b></p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=removed><span xss=removed>Despite\r\nhaving much strength in many aspects of the new curriculum, difficulty in\r\nimplementation, lack of standards among institutions, inadequate arrangement\r\nfor continuous staff development, disharmonious assessment, and insufficient\r\nacademic standards and quality assurance have converted this curriculum\r\npractically to a little better than a syllabus.

The sort of behavioral changes that the school attempts to bring about constitute the educational objectives.  Taxonomies of learning are the hierarchical classification in the field of education, have been developed by various groups concern with educational problems to help teachers to formulate precisely the educational objective. Taxonomy guides in grouping of objectives into types of learning capabilities utilized to plan the conditions required for successful learning, to determine the sequence of a segment of course to formulate instructional design and evaluation system.  The taxonomy guides all about in an educational program.  The important taxonomy are Bloom\'s Taxonomy, SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of Observed Learning Outcome) and McGuire preparation for achievement test. Educational psychologist consider three working levels of taxonomy to satisfy the need of evaluation.  The framework elaborated by Bloom and his colleague consist of six major categories: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. Bloom classifies educational objectives into three domains, namely:\r\n1. The cognitive or mental skills (Knowledge) domain.\r\n2. The Affective or emotional (Attitude) domain.\r\n3. The psychomotor or physical skills domain.\r\nThe cognitive domain:\r\nThe cognitive domain refers to categories related to knowledge, comprehension, and critical thinking of a particular topic. Bloom classified these categories into six levels, moving through the lowest order processes to the highest:\r\ni. Knowledge\r\nRecalling facts, terms, basic concepts and answers. \r\nVerbs: arrange, define, duplicate, label, list, memorize, name, order, recognize, relate, recall, repeat, reproduce, state.\r\nii. Comprehension\r\nDemonstrative understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating main ideas. \r\nVerbs: classify, describe, discuss, explain, express, identify, indicate, locate, recognize, report, restate, review, select, translate.\r\niii. Application\r\nUsing new knowledge. Applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules in a different way.\r\nVerbs: apply, choose, demonstrate, dramatize, employ, illustrate, interpret, operate, practice, schedule, sketch, solve, use, write.\r\niv. Analysis\r\nExamine and break information into parts.\r\nVerbs: analyze, appraise, calculate, categorize, compare, contrast, criticize, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test.\r\nv. Synthesis\r\nAssemble information together in a different way by combining elements in a new pattern or proposing alternative solutions.\r\nVerbs: arrange, assemble, collect, compose, construct, create, design, develop, formulate, manage, organize, plan, prepare, propose, set up, write.\r\nvi. Evaluation\r\nAssessing value, making judgments about information, validity of ideas or quality of work.\r\nVerbs: appraise, argue, assess, attach, choose compare, defend estimate, judge, predict, rate, core, select, support, value, evaluate.\r\nThe Affective domain:\r\nThe target in the affective domain is awareness and growth in attitudes, emotion, and feelings – emotional reaction and ability to feel another living thing’s pain or joy. Five levels are identified in the affective domain moving through the lowest order processes to the highest:\r\ni.Receiving\r\nThe lowest level; the student passively pays attention. Without this level no learning can occur.\r\nii.Responding\r\nNot only does the student attend the learning process but also responds and participates in some way.\r\niii.Valuing\r\nSeeing worth in new information\r\niv.Organizing\r\nFitting the new information into existing schema and deciding how the new information makes sense for you\r\nv.Characterizing\r\nMaking the new information part of your schema and exhibiting new behavior, attitude or belief\r\nThe Psychomotor domain:\r\nThe Psychomotor Domain is skill based and refers to the learning of skills. Physical skills are the ability to move, act, or manually manipulate the body to perform a physical movement. There are  three levels in the psychomotor domain according to RH Dave (1967)\r\nImportance of taxonomy include the following:\r\ni. Bloom’s taxonomy provides a universally effective strategy for creating all type of content to impart learning.\r\nii. The taxonomy helps teachers make decisions about the classification of content.\r\niii. Taxonomy also helps teachers map content to tasks that students need to perform.\r\niv. Taxonomy guides teachers to develop higher levels of thinking process for critical thinking or creative thinking.\r\nv. Using the taxonomy a teacher develops questions or projects that require the development of thinking and reflection from the knowledge level to the evaluation level.\r\nvi. A teacher or a syllabus designer designs a curriculum as well as classroom assignment using taxonomy to advance the learning process from recalling learning materials to higher level of thinking.\r\nvii. A teacher creates class activities based on Taxonomy.\r\nImportance of learning objective include the following:\r\nI. It provides directions to the instructor and it clearly conveys his instructional intent to others.\r\nII. It provides a guide for selecting the subject matter, the teaching method and the materials to be used during instruction.\r\nIII. It provides a guide for constructing tests and other instruments for evaluating student achievement.\r\nIV. If the expected learning outcomes are conveyed to the students, these outcomes also serve as a guide for the students learning activities.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives on  “study of tumour” according to the hierarchies in each learning domain:\r\n1.

Write at least 5 specific objectives on any topic of your speciality according to the hierarchies in each learning domain', 'Assignment\r\nA helpful way to approach any challenge is to use a taxonomy as a guideline. A taxonomy is just a fancy term for the practice and science of classification. Taxonomies are developed to provide a framework for organizing a continuum along an underlying structure. \r\nTaxonomies of learning are the hierarchical classification in the field of education, have been developed by various groups concern with educational problems to help teachers to formulate precisely the educational objective. \r\nThe important taxonomies are Bloom\'s Taxonomy, SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of Observed Learning Outcome) and McGuire preparation for achievement test. Educational psychologist consider three working levels of taxonomy to satisfy the need of evaluation\r\nIn 1956, Dr. Benjamin Bloom and several other educational psychologists published set of guidelines for developing educational objectives. Known as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this framework clarified the different stages of learning into three main domains: cognitive, psychomotor and affective.\r\nBloom’s taxonomy primarily provides instructors with a focus for developing their course learning objectives. It can be used to increase one\'s understanding of the educational process. \r\nBloom\'s taxonomy was developed to provide a common language for teachers to discuss and exchange learning and assessment methods. \r\n      Importance of taxonomy in educational program:\r\n1)  Taxonomy is a helpful tool in writing objectives and identifying how well the students comprehend a concept. \r\n2) It indicates the type of learning outcome that should be considered and it also provides a framework for classifying those outcomes.\r\n3) Specific learning objectives can be derived from the taxonomy, though it is most commonly used to assess learning on a variety of cognitive levels.\r\n4) It helps to determine the sequence of a segment of course to formulate instructional design and evaluation system.\r\n5) It also help educators focus on all three domains when teaching, thus creating a much more holistic form of education that can fit different learning styles and increase retention.\r\n6) It encourages higher-order thought in the students by building up from lower-level cognitive skills.\r\n7)  It also helps in Knowing the different levels and looking for where students fall among them  that will enable the fascilitators to move them from a basic level of understanding to a more complex level. \r\n8) This understanding facilitates the prioritizing of material and can steer the organization of lessons to maximize class time. For example, lower-level skills (e.g., memorizing factual knowledge) can be developed before higher-level skills are introduced (e.g., analysis of relationships).\r\n9) Beyond writing objectives, taxonomy is also extremely helpful in assessing students’ understanding of concepts.\r\n10) Taxonomy can be used as a checklist to ensure that all levels of a domain have been assessed and align assessment methods with the appropriate lessons and methodologies.\r\n11) It provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs.\r\nThe taxonomy guides all about in an educational program.\r\nIn this way, the taxonomy also makes it easier for instructors to maintain consistency between assessment methods, content and instructional materials and identify weak areas.\r\nLearning objectives are also called instructional objectives or performance objectives. They are the statements that describe what students will be able to do once they successfully complete a unit of instruction .\r\n Learning objectives are goals, not the activities performed to achieve those goals.\r\nA good learning objective is specific, measurable, and clearly stated. Learning objectives are a critical component of instruction. It describes the learner behavior It describes the behavior that can be seen or heard. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum.\r\n     Importance of learning objective educational program :\r\n1. It provides a guideline for content\r\n2. Helps in preparing a lesson plan\r\n3. Provide course developers guidance on selecting suitable: \r\no instructional materials;\r\no teaching methods, including learning activities and use of technology;\r\no assessment methods.\r\n4. Help students focus on what they are expected to learn, and understand how they will be assessed.\r\n5. It provides a guideline of evaluation\r\n6. A clearly stated learning objective can help an instructor create appropriate learning activities to help students acquire the desired skills and select good assessment tools to evaluate students\' achievement.\r\nThat’s why it is always emphasized that learning objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, transferable. Learning objectives target knowledge, skills or attitudes for change. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum\r\n\r\nI am from Biochemistry specialty and my topic is “Clinical Biochemistry and Endocrinology”\r\nFrom cognitive domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Define bilirubin and state different types of serum bilirubin\r\n• Explain the mechanism of development of hyperbilirubinaemia\r\n• State the indication of measurement of serum bilirubin\r\n• Differentiate different types of jaundice from serum bilirubin level\r\n• State the other biomarkers to differentiate different types of jaundice\r\nFrom psychomotor domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Asses the subject whether he is ready for the procedure (estimation of serum bilirubin)\r\n• Collect specimen properly from the appropriate site without any complication\r\n• Perform the test properly by using appropriate reagent and instruments\r\n• Interpret the test results\r\nFrom Affective domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Attend the subject properly and listen his complains\r\n• State the subject about the importance of the test regarding his condition\r\n• Correlate the test result with the pathological condition\r\n• support the subject mentally\r\nEducational objectives are short, well structured statements that specifies what the learners are expected to achieve at the end of an educational program.\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-27 23:24:44', 'upload/attachment/125dd0434d1b2c69a31b47a7a7e83a94.doc', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\" xss=\"removed\" xss=removed><span xss=\"removed\">Dear fellow<o></o></span></p><p xss=\"removed\" xss=removed><span xss=\"removed\">Thanks for your much effort for preparing  assignment.

To highlight the importance of taxonomy and learning objectives in educational program\r\n2. Example of a topic in nephrology with objectives indicating hierarchies of each learning domain\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nEducation is a process that brings about expected changes in human behavior. Educational objective is defined as what the students should be able to do at the end of a learning period that they could not do beforehand. Mager defined educational objective as “an intent communicated by a statement describing a proposed change in a learner when he has successfully completed a learning experience”. Objectives may be general and specific. Learning objectives serve as guidelines for content, instruction and evaluation. There remains a SMART way of writing learning objectives. It should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and transferable. \r\nThe taxonomy of educational objectives is intended to provide for classification of the educational system. In 1956, Benjamin Bloom published taxonomy of learning objectives containing three major domains namely cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains. \r\nImportance of learning objectives:\r\nLearning objectives is the cornerstone in any educational program. These guide the whole process of teaching learning for the particular goal(s). If the general and specific objectives are not set from the beginning, it is impossible to plan the curriculum, its content, how these acts will be done and how will be assessed. So, without objectives no educational activity is set. It will be like that of sailing in the sea without the destination and a compass.\r\nAim is the overall direction like aim of undergraduate medical education (MBBS) is to make medical graduates able to serve community needs. The general objective of this program is to ensure some defined knowledge, skills and attitudes that students should attain throughout the course. The specific objectives are further details; suppose, to deal a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis they should be able to state symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, elicit relevant clinical findings (if present), plan for investigating the case, make a treatment plan and counsel the patient and caregiver(s)/family members regarding importance of treatment adherence, possible adverse effects of drugs, transmission of disease (tuberculosis) etc.\r\nImportance of taxonomy:\r\nTaxonomy of educational objectives serves different objectives:\r\n- Indicates the type of learning outcomes that should be considered\r\n- Provides a framework for classifying those outcomes\r\n- Directs attention towards changes in students’ performance in a variety of areas\r\n- Forms the blue print for the assessment tool\r\n- Provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs easier\r\nEvaluation of urinary tract infection (UTI) is planned with hierarchies of each learning domains\r\nCognitive domain:\r\nObjectives: Undergraduate medical students are expected to know following facts regarding UTI.\r\nEvaluation Why a patient with UTI is not responding to oral ciprofloxacin? \r\nThink about antibiotic resistance\r\nSynthesis\r\n Accumulation of facts e.g. clinical presentation, examination findings and lab. reports to make a diagnosis of UTI\r\nAnalysis Analysis \r\nApplication Ability to plan diagnostic tests in suspected UTI cases\r\nComprehension Ability to make a diagnosis of UTI from a given scenario \r\nRecall Define UTI\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychomotor domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to perform relevant clinical examination in a setting of UTI/pyelonephritis.\r\nOrganization  Student may show peers how to examine for renal angle tenderness\r\nAdaptation  Advanced learner may perform the act in a different situation like sitting position\r\nComplex overt response Students perform in presence of trainer\r\nMechanism  Trainer performs the act (identifies anatomical landmark first)\r\nGuided response  Trainer will describe first “how to examine for renal angle tenderness?”\r\nSet  Student stands on right side of examination couch\r\nPerception  Candidate is able to understand the instruction “examine for renal angle tenderness” in suspected UTI (pyelonephritis) \r\n\r\nAffective domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to counsel patient/family member(s) regarding UTI.\r\nCharacterization by value Internalize in candidate’s behavior for further cases\r\nOrganization  Have to be ready to offer effective help/empathy\r\nValuing  Will be ready to accept patients ideas/concerns\r\nResponding  Student/candidate will have to be ready to receive and answer question/quarries \r\nReceiving  Instruction: This 35-year-old diabetic patient is having recurrent UTI. Counsel her regarding the disease and consequences\r\n(Can recognize the situation when patients and care givers are waiting for information received from lab. reports)\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nEducational objectives are the core of an educational program. In any given topic of medical education, efforts should be given to organize objectives in different domains whenever possible for a better learning outcome.\r\n', '2018-01-28 12:03:34', 'upload/attachment/609595b11e502d1c92d15743233404d1.doc', '<p>Well written!</p><p>While writing learning objectives, it is important to select appropriate action verb</p><p>You did not write anything on the task- writing 5 learning capabilities that human can learn<br></p>', NULL, '2018-01-29 00:03:34', 'F');

Write at least 5 specific objectives on any topic of your specialty according to the hierarchies in each learning domain', 'Assignment\r\nA helpful way to approach any challenge is to use a taxonomy as a guideline. A taxonomy is just a fancy term for the practice and science of classification. Taxonomies are developed to provide a framework for organizing a continuum along an underlying structure. \r\nTaxonomies of learning are the hierarchical classification in the field of education, have been developed by various groups concern with educational problems to help teachers to formulate precisely the educational objective. \r\nThe important taxonomies are Bloom\'s Taxonomy, SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of Observed Learning Outcome) and McGuire preparation for achievement test. Educational psychologist consider three working levels of taxonomy to satisfy the need of evaluation\r\nIn 1956, Dr. Benjamin Bloom and several other educational psychologists published set of guidelines for developing educational objectives. Known as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this framework clarified the different stages of learning into three main domains: cognitive, psychomotor and affective.\r\nBloom’s taxonomy primarily provides instructors with a focus for developing their course learning objectives. It can be used to increase one\'s understanding of the educational process. \r\nBloom\'s taxonomy was developed to provide a common language for teachers to discuss and exchange learning and assessment methods. \r\n      Importance of taxonomy in educational program:\r\n1)  Taxonomy is a helpful tool in writing objectives and identifying how well the students comprehend a concept. \r\n2) It indicates the type of learning outcome that should be considered and it also provides a framework for classifying those outcomes.\r\n3) Specific learning objectives can be derived from the taxonomy, though it is most commonly used to assess learning on a variety of cognitive levels.\r\n4) It helps to determine the sequence of a segment of course to formulate instructional design and evaluation system.\r\n5) It also help educators focus on all three domains when teaching, thus creating a much more holistic form of education that can fit different learning styles and increase retention.\r\n6) It encourages higher-order thought in the students by building up from lower-level cognitive skills.\r\n7)  It also helps in Knowing the different levels and looking for where students fall among them  that will enable the fascilitators to move them from a basic level of understanding to a more complex level. \r\n8) This understanding facilitates the prioritizing of material and can steer the organization of lessons to maximize class time. For example, lower-level skills (e.g., memorizing factual knowledge) can be developed before higher-level skills are introduced (e.g., analysis of relationships).\r\n9) Beyond writing objectives, taxonomy is also extremely helpful in assessing students’ understanding of concepts.\r\n10) Taxonomy can be used as a checklist to ensure that all levels of a domain have been assessed and align assessment methods with the appropriate lessons and methodologies.\r\n11) It provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs.\r\nThe taxonomy guides all about in an educational program.\r\nIn this way, the taxonomy also makes it easier for instructors to maintain consistency between assessment methods, content and instructional materials and identify weak areas.\r\nLearning objectives are also called instructional objectives or performance objectives. They are the statements that describe what students will be able to do once they successfully complete a unit of instruction .\r\n Learning objectives are goals, not the activities performed to achieve those goals.\r\nA good learning objective is specific, measurable, and clearly stated. Learning objectives are a critical component of instruction. It describes the learner behavior It describes the behavior that can be seen or heard. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum.\r\n     Importance of learning objective educational program :\r\n1. It provides a guideline for content\r\n2. Helps in preparing a lesson plan\r\n3. Provide course developers guidance on selecting suitable: \r\no instructional materials;\r\no teaching methods, including learning activities and use of technology;\r\no assessment methods.\r\n4. Help students focus on what they are expected to learn, and understand how they will be assessed.\r\n5. It provides a guideline of evaluation\r\n6. A clearly stated learning objective can help an instructor create appropriate learning activities to help students acquire the desired skills and select good assessment tools to evaluate students\' achievement.\r\nThat’s why it is always emphasized that learning objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, transferable. Learning objectives target knowledge, skills or attitudes for change. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum\r\n\r\nI am from Biochemistry specialty and my topic is “Clinical Biochemistry and Endocrinology”\r\nFrom cognitive domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Define bilirubin and state different types of serum bilirubin\r\n• Explain the mechanism of development of hyperbilirubinaemia\r\n• State the indication of measurement of serum bilirubin\r\n• Differentiate different types of jaundice from serum bilirubin level\r\n• State the other biomarkers to differentiate different types of jaundice\r\nFrom psychomotor domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Asses the subject whether he is ready for the procedure (estimation of serum bilirubin)\r\n• Collect specimen properly from the appropriate site without any complication\r\n• Perform the test properly by using appropriate reagent and instruments\r\n• Interpret the test results\r\nFrom Affective domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Attend the subject properly and listen his complains\r\n• State the subject about the importance of the test regarding his condition\r\n• Correlate the test result with the pathological condition\r\n• support the subject mentally\r\nEducational objectives are short, well structured statements that specifies what the learners are expected to achieve at the end of an educational program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-26 04:42:38', 'upload/attachment/429216770e554eb158c131e2a7482947.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (66, 35, 'Assignment ', 'A. Importance of Learning Objectives in Educational Program\r\nI. Introduction\r\nIn educational program learning objectives are brief statements that describes what students will be expected to learn by the end of study year, course, unit lesson, project or class period. It is the cornerstone of instructional technology, precise and detail, relates to one aspect of area. All learners need to know what is expected of them – in other words they need to be informed of learning outcomes/objectives. Once the contents to be included in a lesson have been decided by need assessment, task analysis, curricular guides or other materials, the next step is to develop, write or select the objectives which will comprise of the unit of instructions. \r\nII. Importance\r\n“Remember that if you don’t know where you are going, you can’t know how to get there.” The statement stresses the importance of learning outcome. Selection of learning objectives are important in every aspect of teaching learning process. \r\n• Objectives contribute to instructional process in the following ways:\r\n It provides direction for the instructor and it clearly conveys his instructional intent to others. \r\n It provides a guide for selecting the subject matter, the teaching method and the materials to be used during instructions. \r\n It provides a guide for constructing test and other instruments for evaluating student achievement. \r\n• Learning objective tell students what is important: \r\nWithout learning objectives it is difficult for students to know what they are supposed to be learning. In a lecture, teacher can talk extensively about a case but unless he or she states explicitly, it can be difficult for students to know where to direct their attention. Do they need to know the details of that specific case or what principles are they supposed to glean from the example? Students can waste a great deal of time studying the things that are not necessary, to the detriment of their learning as a whole. The uncertainty also cause unnecessary anxiety.  \r\n• Learning objectives enable good assessment development:\r\nEach year as we write our assessments we should go through the learning objectives and make sure their assessed. In this way, the assessment becomes fair and applied to the course. \r\n• Learning objectives encourage reflection and good course design and development:\r\nDevelopment is an intrinsic part of medicine. Knowledge has grown rapidly over the last fifty years, new skill have become a routine part of practice and old skills have become redundant. As instructors write and review the learning objectives in a course, they can identify the level of learning that is specified in each. At an entry level course it is acceptable to have a number of lower level learning objectives. However, there needs to be some serious thinking done if a post-graduate course is not mainly made up of higher level learning objectives. The use of learning objectives linked with assessment design helps us to identify the background knowledge that we assume students have.  \r\n• Learning objectives promotes equity and reduces unnecessary stress:\r\nLearning objectives help reduce the ‘gaming’ aspects that can proliferate in the absence of clear information. \r\n\r\nIII. Conclusion\r\nThe derivation, development, organization and formulation of objectives are among the most difficult of the educational tasks a faculty must performed. Unless this work is done, the effort invested in teaching learning process represents long journey with neither compass nor map. \r\n\r\nB. Importance of Taxonomy in Educational Program\r\nI. Introduction\r\nTaxonomy is as old as the language skill of the mankind. Taxonomy is important because it allows us to represent the evolution of living organisms expose the differences and similarities between them. The taxonomy of educational objectives is intended to provide for classification of the goals of the educational system. Although the specific learning outcomes resulting from a course of study may run into hundreds, most of them can be classified under a small number of headings. One of the most important aim in post primary education is the attainment of critical or higher order thinking skills. Identifying how to encourage, teach and then assess their skills is important. Taxonomy of educational objectives is regarded as a tool for such.  \r\nII. Importance\r\n• Taxonomy is a language for communication, and essential infrastructure for other activities in society. Lack of good taxonomy and skilled taxonomists is an impediment for society. If a researcher does not have a reliable name on his/her study object, it is impossible to communicate and publish on the results.  If the taxonomy is poor studies may be conducted on different texa but reported by the same name create confusion. It is an essential infrastructure for other fields. \r\n• Taxonomy serves several useful purposes: \r\n Indicates the type of learning outcomes that should be considered.\r\n Provides a framework for classifying those outcomes. \r\n Directs attention towards changes in student performance in variety of areas \r\n Useful in designing a lesson plan and can be used to adopt a previously designed lesson\r\n Forms the blueprint for forming the assessment tools- taxonomy can help by providing lists of competencies available and in setting an appropriate level of performance.\r\n Asking questions at different taxonomic levels.\r\n Increasing the cognitive levels of activity.\r\n Provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching program easier. \r\n\r\nIII. Conclusion\r\nTo determine the standard to which the student will full-fill the learning outcome hierarchies of the taxonomy is important assessment tool. \r\n\r\nC.

Taxonomies are developed to provide a framework for organizing a continuum along an underlying structure. \r\nThe important taxonomies are Bloom\'s Taxonomy, SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of Observed Learning Outcome) and McGuire preparation for achievement test. Educational psychologist consider three working levels of taxonomy to satisfy the need of evaluation\r\nBloom’s taxonomy primarily provides instructors with a focus for developing their course learning objectives. It can be used to increase one\'s understanding of the educational process. \r\nBloom\'s taxonomy was developed to provide a common language for teachers to discuss and exchange learning and assessment methods. \r\n      Importance of taxonomy in educational program:\r\n1)  Taxonomy is a helpful tool in writing objectives and identifying how well the students comprehend a concept. \r\n2) It indicates the type of learning outcome that should be considered and it also provides a framework for classifying those outcomes.\r\n3) Specific learning objectives can be derived from the taxonomy, though it is most commonly used to assess learning on a variety of cognitive levels.\r\n4) It helps to determine the sequence of a segment of course to formulate instructional design and evaluation system.\r\n5) It also help educators focus on all three domains when teaching, thus creating a much more holistic form of education that can fit different learning styles and increase retention.\r\n6) It encourages higher-order thought in the students by building up from lower-level cognitive skills.\r\n7)  It also helps in Knowing the different levels and looking for where students fall among them  that will enable the fascilitators to move them from a basic level of understanding to a more complex level. \r\n8) This understanding facilitates the prioritizing of material and can steer the organization of lessons to maximize class time. For example, lower-level skills (e.g., memorizing factual knowledge) can be developed before higher-level skills are introduced (e.g., analysis of relationships).\r\n9) Beyond writing objectives, taxonomy is also extremely helpful in assessing students’ understanding of concepts.\r\n10) Taxonomy can be used as a checklist to ensure that all levels of a domain have been assessed and align assessment methods with the appropriate lessons and methodologies.\r\n11) It provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs.\r\nThe taxonomy guides all about in an educational program.\r\nIn this way, the taxonomy also makes it easier for instructors to maintain consistency between assessment methods, content and instructional materials and identify weak areas.\r\nLearning objectives are also called instructional objectives or performance objectives. They are the statements that describe what students will be able to do once they successfully complete a unit of instruction .\r\n Learning objectives are goals, not the activities performed to achieve those goals.\r\nA good learning objective is specific, measurable, and clearly stated. Learning objectives are a critical component of instruction. It describes the learner behavior It describes the behavior that can be seen or heard. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum.\r\n    \r\n\r\n Importance of learning objective educational program:\r\n1. It provides desirable educational outcome at the end of the session\r\n2. It provides a guideline for content\r\n3. Helps in preparing a lesson plan\r\n4. Provide course developers guidance on selecting suitable: \r\no instructional materials;\r\no teaching methods, including learning activities and use of technology;\r\no assessment methods.\r\n5. Help students focus on what they are expected to learn, and understand how they will be assessed.\r\n6. It provides a guideline of evaluation\r\n7. A clearly stated learning objective can help an instructor create appropriate learning activities to help students acquire the desired skills and select good assessment tools to evaluate students\' achievement.\r\nThat’s why it is always emphasized that learning objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, transferable. Learning objectives target knowledge, skills or attitudes for change. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum\r\nI am from Biochemistry specialty and my topic is “Clinical Biochemistry and Endocrinology”\r\nFrom cognitive domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• State the normal level of serum bilirubin and define hyperbilirubinaemia and Jaundice \r\n• State different types of serum bilirubin \r\n• Explain the mechanism of development of hyperbilirubinaemia\r\n• State the indication of measurement of serum bilirubin\r\n• Differentiate different types of jaundice from serum bilirubin level\r\n• State the other biomarkers to differentiate different types of jaundice\r\n• Interpret the biochemical values of different types serum bilirubin in different types of jaundice\r\nFrom psychomotor domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Collect specimen properly from the appropriate site with adequate precaution without any complication\r\n• Process the sample properly and with in time\r\n• Select proper reagents required for the test\r\n• Select proper instruments required for the test\r\n• Perform the test properly by using appropriate reagent and instruments\r\nFrom Affective domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Attend the subject properly and listen his complains\r\n• State the subject about the importance of the test regarding his condition\r\n• Correlate the test result with the pathological condition\r\n• support the subject mentally\r\nEducational objectives are short, well structured statements that specifies what the learners are expected to achieve at the end of an educational program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-28 05:15:42', 'upload/attachment/a1190b4ae0e77a6f5ecbadae5075d734.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Educational psychologist consider three working levels of taxonomy to satisfy the need of evaluation\r\nBloom’s taxonomy primarily provides instructors with a focus for developing their course learning objectives. It can be used to increase one\'s understanding of the educational process. \r\nBloom\'s taxonomy was developed to provide a common language for teachers to discuss and exchange learning and assessment methods. \r\n      Importance of taxonomy in educational program:\r\n1)  Taxonomy is a helpful tool in writing objectives and identifying how well the students comprehend a concept. \r\n2) It indicates the type of learning outcome that should be considered and it also provides a framework for classifying those outcomes.\r\n3) Specific learning objectives can be derived from the taxonomy, though it is most commonly used to assess learning on a variety of cognitive levels.\r\n4) It helps to determine the sequence of a segment of course to formulate instructional design and evaluation system.\r\n5) It also help educators focus on all three domains when teaching, thus creating a much more holistic form of education that can fit different learning styles and increase retention.\r\n6) It encourages higher-order thought in the students by building up from lower-level cognitive skills.\r\n7)  It also helps in Knowing the different levels and looking for where students fall among them  that will enable the fascilitators to move them from a basic level of understanding to a more complex level. \r\n8) This understanding facilitates the prioritizing of material and can steer the organization of lessons to maximize class time. For example, lower-level skills (e.g., memorizing factual knowledge) can be developed before higher-level skills are introduced (e.g., analysis of relationships).\r\n9) Beyond writing objectives, taxonomy is also extremely helpful in assessing students’ understanding of concepts.\r\n10) Taxonomy can be used as a checklist to ensure that all levels of a domain have been assessed and align assessment methods with the appropriate lessons and methodologies.\r\n11) It provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs.\r\nThe taxonomy guides all about in an educational program.\r\nIn this way, the taxonomy also makes it easier for instructors to maintain consistency between assessment methods, content and instructional materials and identify weak areas.\r\nLearning objectives are also called instructional objectives or performance objectives. They are the statements that describe what students will be able to do once they successfully complete a unit of instruction .\r\n Learning objectives are goals, not the activities performed to achieve those goals.\r\nA good learning objective is specific, measurable, and clearly stated. Learning objectives are a critical component of instruction. It describes the learner behavior It describes the behavior that can be seen or heard. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum.\r\n    \r\n\r\n Importance of learning objective educational program:\r\n1. It provides desirable educational outcome at the end of the session\r\n2. It provides a guideline for content\r\n3. Helps in preparing a lesson plan\r\n4. Provide course developers guidance on selecting suitable: \r\no instructional materials;\r\no teaching methods, including learning activities and use of technology;\r\no assessment methods.\r\n5. Help students focus on what they are expected to learn, and understand how they will be assessed.\r\n6. It provides a guideline of evaluation\r\n7. A clearly stated learning objective can help an instructor create appropriate learning activities to help students acquire the desired skills and select good assessment tools to evaluate students\' achievement.\r\nThat’s why it is always emphasized that learning objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, transferable. Learning objectives target knowledge, skills or attitudes for change. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum\r\nI am from Biochemistry specialty and my topic is “Clinical Biochemistry and Endocrinology”\r\nFrom cognitive domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• State the normal level of serum bilirubin and define hyperbilirubinaemia and Jaundice \r\n• State different types of serum bilirubin \r\n• Explain the mechanism of development of hyperbilirubinaemia\r\n• State the indication of measurement of serum bilirubin\r\n• Differentiate different types of jaundice from serum bilirubin level\r\n• State the other biomarkers to differentiate different types of jaundice\r\n• Interpret the biochemical values of different types serum bilirubin in different types of jaundice\r\nFrom psychomotor domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Collect specimen properly from the appropriate site with adequate precaution without any complication\r\n• Process the sample properly and with in time\r\n• Select proper reagents required for the test\r\n• Select proper instruments required for the test\r\n• Perform the test properly by using appropriate reagent and instruments\r\nFrom Affective domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Attend the subject properly and listen his complains\r\n• State the subject about the importance of the test regarding his condition\r\n• Correlate the test result with the pathological condition\r\n• support the subject mentally\r\nEducational objectives are short, well structured statements that specifies what the learners are expected to achieve at the end of an educational program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-28 05:20:00', 'upload/attachment/49fa7bef357e059a028105d596f6ae5f.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

To highlight the importance of taxonomy and learning objectives in educational program\r\n2. Example of a topic in nephrology (urinary tract infection, UTI) with objectives indicating hierarchies of each learning domain\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nEducation is a process that brings about expected changes in human behavior. Educational objective is defined as what the students should be able to do at the end of a learning period that they could not do beforehand. Mager defined educational objective as “an intent communicated by a statement describing a proposed change in a learner when he has successfully completed a learning experience”. Objectives may be general and specific. Learning objectives serve as guidelines for content, instruction and evaluation. There remains a SMART way of writing learning objectives. It should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and transferable. \r\nThe taxonomy of educational objectives is intended to provide for classification of the educational system. In 1956, Benjamin Bloom published taxonomy of learning objectives containing three major domains namely cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains. \r\nImportance of learning objectives:\r\nLearning objectives is the cornerstone in any educational program. These guide the whole process of teaching learning for the particular goal(s). If the general and specific objectives are not set from the beginning, it is impossible to plan the curriculum, its content, how these acts will be done and how will be assessed. So, without objectives no educational activity is set. It will be like that of sailing in the sea without the destination and a compass.\r\nAim is the overall direction like aim of undergraduate medical education (MBBS) is to make medical graduates able to serve community needs. The general objective of this program is to ensure some defined knowledge, skills and attitudes that students should attain throughout the course. The specific objectives are further details; suppose, to deal a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis they should be able to state symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, elicit relevant clinical findings (if present), plan for investigating the case, make a treatment plan and counsel the patient and caregiver(s)/family members regarding importance of treatment adherence, possible adverse effects of drugs, transmission of disease (tuberculosis) etc.\r\n\r\nImportance of taxonomy:\r\nTaxonomy of educational objectives serves different objectives:\r\n- Indicates the type of learning outcomes that should be considered\r\n- Provides a framework for classifying those outcomes\r\n- Directs attention towards changes in students’ performance in a variety of areas\r\n- Forms the blue print for the assessment tool\r\n- Provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs easier\r\nEvaluation of urinary tract infection (UTI) is planned with hierarchies of each learning domains\r\nCognitive domain:\r\nObjectives: Undergraduate medical students are expected to know following facts regarding UTI\r\nEvaluation Assess and evaluate treatment response.\r\nSynthesis Now summarize the whole scenario.\r\nAnalysis Urine routine test revealed 15-20 pus cells per high power field (HPF) and 1-2 red blood cells/HPF. Urine culture revealed growth of Escherichia coli. Now analyze the report.\r\nApplication Mention two tests that you will request in this case and explain why?\r\nComprehension Interpret the scenario: A 30-year-old lady presented with dysuria, increased urinary frequency and fever. What is the most likely diagnosis?\r\nRecall Define UTI and name two common organisms responsible for UTI\r\n\r\nPsychomotor domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to perform relevant clinical examination in a setting of UTI/pyelonephritis\r\nInstruction: Examine for renal angle tenderness\r\nOrganization  Student may perform the act skillfully in front of peers how to examine for renal angle tenderness\r\nAdaptation  Advanced learner may perform the act in a different situation like sitting position\r\nComplex overt response Students perform in presence of trainer\r\nMechanism  Trainer performs the act (identifies anatomical landmark first)\r\nGuided response  Trainer will describe first “how to examine for renal angle tenderness?”\r\nSet  Student  walks to the right side of examination couch\r\nPerception  Candidate is able to understand the instruction “examine for renal angle tenderness” in suspected UTI (pyelonephritis) case\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAffective domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to counsel patient/family member(s) regarding UTI\r\nInstruction: Counsel the patient and her family members regarding the diagnosis and prognosis\r\nCharacterization by value Revise the act and internalize in candidate’s behavior for further cases\r\nOrganization  Discuss in details and organize effective help/empathy\r\nValuing  Recognize and appreciate patient’s ideas/concerns\r\nResponding  Student/candidate will comply to receive and answer question/quarries \r\nReceiving  Student listens to the instruction: This 35-year-old diabetic patient is having recurrent UTI.

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (93, 63, 'Plan to improve educational environment and staff development program of Psychiatry Department BIRDEM & IMC', 'Learning environments are educational approaches, cultures, and physical settings for all types of learners and activities. Several of the key trends in educational models throughout the 20th and early 21st century include progressive education, constructivist education, and 21st century skills-based education. These can be provided in comprehensive or specialized schools in a variety of organizational models, including departmental, integrative, project-based, academy, small learning communities, and school-within-a-school. Each of these can also be paired, at least in part, with design-based, virtual school, flipped classroom, and blended learning models. We can apply these to our medical set up as well. We believe that the learning environment for medical education shapes the patient care environment. The highest quality of safe and effective care for patients and the highest quality of effective and appropriate education are rooted in human dignity. We embrace our responsibility to create, support, and facilitate the learning environment shared by our patients, learners, and teachers. In this environment, our patients witness, experience, and expect a pervasive sense of respect, collegiality, kindness, and cooperation among health care team members. This includes all professionals, administrators, staff, and beginning and advanced learners from all health professions. This includes research as well as patient care environments. We affirm our responsibility to create, support, and facilitate a learning environment that fosters resilience in all participants. It is our responsibility to create an atmosphere in which our learners and teachers are willing to engage with learning processes that can be inherently uncomfortable and challenging. We affirm our commitment to shaping a culture of teaching and learning that is rooted in respect for all. Fostering resilience, excellence, compassion, and integrity allows us to create patient care, research, and learning environments that are built upon constructive collaboration, mutual respect, and human dignity \r\nIn Bangladesh mental health expenditures from government health department are very insignificant and are less than 0.5%. In terms of affordability of mental health services less than 0.11% of the population has free access to essential psychotropic medication. The total number of human resources working in mental health facilities or private practice per 100,000 populations is 0.49 as stated in WHO-AIMS, 2005 report.  We have Stigma in the society, less awareness about mental health and inadequate manpower. However we have to try and overcome this adverse situation & we can only do it by improving the educational environment and proper staff development.\r\nTeachers, in their role in the learning environment, must teach to support and actively incorporate elements of motivation. We must ensure that when using innovative and fun teaching strategies, we embed elements that motivate our learners to do better. \r\nPlan to Improve Educational Environment and staff development program for the Department of Psychiatry, BIRDEM & IMC-\r\nLearning depends on several factors, but a crucial step is the engagement of the learner. This is affected by their motivation and perception of relevance. These, in turn, can be affected by learners\' previous experiences and preferred learning styles and by the context and environment in which the learning is taking place. In adult learning theories, teaching is as much about setting the context or climate for learning as it is about imparting knowledge or sharing expertise.  \r\nRegarding learning environment of my specialty I want to arrange role play and visit in community and tertiary care hospital which will motivate them for learning psychiatry by reducing stigma and negative attitude. I want to provide online self-assessment questioners for my students which will also motivate their learning. With the help of organization a Virtual learning environment can be created including online tools, databases and managed resources. Students can watch videos of rare and difficult cases which are not commonly presented in our Institute. Teaching and supporting staff is not sufficient for our specialty at present. We need to recruit more teachers and supporting staff for better service to our students.\r\nRegarding Staff development of our specialty teaching improvement is an important aspect. As our department lacks a good number of teachers we should implement self-directed learning by self-reflection & evaluation by students. Videotaping and supportive critiquing through online service from other departments or peer institute can be effective. We can involve students in different community level study through which our skills in conducting scientific study will improve as well. As we know “To teach is to learn twice” principle should be the main motivating factors for staff development.  Staff development programmes should base themselves on the needs of the individuals as well as the institution. Student needs, patient needs and societal needs may help to direct relevant activities. Assessing need is necessary to refine goals, determine content, identify preferred learning formats and assure relevance. So application of written questionnaires or surveys, interviews or focus group with key informants, observation of teachers’ in action’ & literature review  is a must for proper planning to be started for staff development in our institute.\r\n\r\nReferences-\r\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_environment\r\n2.

An enriched learning environment can lead to increased satisfaction, achievement and success as a practitioner. The educational environment has been defined as “environment experienced or perceived by the students as well as by the teachers”. \r\nThese perceptions would be based on three important aspects which include: the physical environment, emotional climate, and intellectual climate. As educational institutes continue to become more student oriented, students’ perceptions of higher educational facilities and services are becoming increasingly important. \r\nI can improve educational environment of my own department in following ways:\r\n1) By assessing and providing proper physical environment like – \r\n• the size of the room\r\n• Temperature of the room\r\n• Avoid distraction (noise, visual distraction)\r\n• Adequate sitting arrangement\r\n•  Adequate audiovisual equipments\r\n                                                                 \r\n2) By providing well equiped laboratory with adequate tools, instruments and reagents\r\n3) By maintaining number of teachers with required qualifications and teacher student ratio\r\n4) By maintaining good student teacher relationship\r\n5) By providing with appealing salaries;and a safe, secure, and comfortable facility to high caliber educators; and by  providing even basic needs for students, such as adequate nutrition, health care, adequate rest, and support at dormitory for homework \r\n6) By planning an academic calender according to course curriculum \r\n7) By discussing with the faculty members about the teaching learning methods to make the curriculum easy by encouraging small group teaching, PBL, \r\n8) By arranging Departmental seminar with the involvement of students and teachers\r\n9) Providing assignment to the students under the guidance of teachers \r\n10) By ensuring good source of informations by developing enriched libraries along with computer and internet facilities\r\n11) By developing virtual learning environment (or VLE) which is increasingly common in higher education and also in medical education. VLE can provide course information such as study guides, forms, workbooks, time tables of exam, academic calendars of schedule events both for students and staffs. Blending of traditional learning and VLE can improve the educational environment.\r\n12) By developing teaching and technical staff of the department\r\n13) As learning environment affects student’s motivation and achievement, it is important to get feedback from the students on how they feel about their learning environment. Students’ perception of the educational environment is a useful basis for modifying and improving its quality. \r\n14) By assessing teacher’s perception about the educational environment is also very important for improvement\r\nTo measure medical and health education environment, the Dundee Ready Education, Environment Measure (DREEM) was developed. \r\n\r\nStaff development or faculty development has become an increasingly essential component in medical education. \r\nStaff development can be viewed as the activities and programs that help staff members learn about their responsibilities, develop required skills and competencies necessary to accomplish institutional and national goals and purposes and grow personally and professionally to prepare themselves for the advancement in the institution or beyond the campus.\r\nStaff development  program take place within the context of a specific institution  and department. It is important to clearly define goals and priorities of the department and according to this we can develop our staffs. \r\nI can improve staff development program of my own department in following ways:\r\n1) Workshop: We can arrange workshops on specific topics like MCQs, SAQs or OSPEs 6 monthly for our teachers by the experts on medical education and  can also send them to other institute like CME for  workshop and can encourage them to share their new achievements.\r\n2)  Short courses: we should always up to date about the short courses that are beneficiary to our teaching staffs according to their educational qualifications and should inform them and encourage them about the courses.\r\n3) Seminars: We can allow our teaching staffs to organize seminars on a specific topic at the the end of each month in the presence of Head of the Department and other seniors and experts who can give them positive feedback.\r\n4) Consultation with professional educators: With the help of an expert of medical education we can guide our teaching staff to make their lesson plan accurately\r\n5) Integrated longitudinal programes: By this program, faculty members allocate 10- 20% of their working hours for improving their educational knowledge and skills by maintaining other activities\r\n6) Peer coaching: It is also called co-teaching. It enables individualized learning and foster collaboration. It also allows health care professionals to learn about each others as they teach togather\r\n7) Mentorship: It is a valuable but underutilized staff development strategy. It promotes the socialization, development and maturation of academic faculty.\r\n8) Self directed learning: It promotes reflection -in -action and reflection- on- action. Teachers should be encouraged to determine their own needs through self reflection, evaluation by students, peer feedback and they should learn to design their own developmental activities. \r\n9) Computer aided instruction: This is closely tied to self-directed learning initiatives. Web based learning can allow for individualized programs targeted to specific needs and the sharing of resources.\r\n10) Performance reward: Staffs can be rewarded for their performances which can motivate them for self development\r\n11) Staff developers should be well trained, experienced and creative.\r\nAs job descriptions, individual goals and even the mission of institution or department may change so staff development plans will be reviewed on a regular basis. Changes to staff development plan shall be made as needed. Both the supervisor and the staff members must agree upon changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-02-05 23:12:30', 'upload/attachment/4ddcaba71e8043e2af7fc8493d6d24a1.doc', '<p>Tanks for your effort.

Towhidur Rahman         ID- GD2GOB\r\nName of the assignment – Write a plan to improve educational environment & how to improve staff development program of your own department.\r\nPlan to improve educational environment in my department (Radiology & Imaging) :\r\nLearning environment is an educational approach, cultural context, or physical setting in which teaching & learning occur. An improved learning environment is very important for achieving a successful educational outcome. We take a policy to develop our own strategy so that every faculty member can get a scope to develop their own carrier.\r\nOperational characteristics: \r\nThe operation of the educational facility can have a determining role of the nature of the learning environment. Before improvement of educational environment of the department operational characteristics of my department should be known which includes-\r\n• Organization type: Private.\r\n• Structure: Less structured\r\n• Schedule: Academic year (July session in every year), class periods (8am to 12 pm)\r\n• Staffing: Number of teachers – 10, other staff – 60.\r\n• Attendance: Student attendance.\r\n• Teacher certification: Post graduate degree-MD, M phil, FCPS\r\n• Assessment: Testing and standards provided by academy.\r\n• Partnerships and mentoring: Relationships between the learning environments and outside entities or individuals in general study.\r\n• Organizational model: Departmental.\r\n• Curriculum: The subjects comprising a course of study.\r\n\r\nA learning culture is a collection of organizational conventions, values, practices and processes. These conventions encourage employees and organizations develop knowledge and competence. Culture affects the behavior of educators, students, staff & community.\r\n\r\nTo create a learning culture into my department following key steps are as follows-\r\n• Formalize training and development plans- For a learning culture to be ingrained, it should be mandatory for all individuals in the department. Example – Hazards of radiation.\r\n• Give recognition to learning-  Employees who have successfully learned new skills and abilities should be recognized and encourage others to follow suit.\r\n• Get feedback-  Sessions and polls should regularly be done to evaluate the benefits of training and development, as well as to determine whether the training investment is well spent.\r\n• Promote from within- One of the advantages of training is having employees who are ready for a bigger role. Announce an internal job posting to encourage employees to gain knowledge.\r\n• Develop knowledge and information sharing into a formal process- People will be more encouraged to share knowledge and information if they are required to do so. Formalizing the process makes sure that everyone who needs the information gets it.\r\n\r\nLearning styles may be included – \r\n*Active learning - Active learning is a model of instruction that focuses the responsibility of learning on learners, not on teacher-led instruction, a model also termed student-centered. It is based on the premise that in order to learn, students must do more than just listen: they must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems.\r\n*Passive learning- Passive learning, a key feature of direct instruction, has at its core the dissemination of nearly all information and knowledge from a single source, the teacher with a textbook providing lessons in lecture-style format.\r\n* Hands on learning – Active & experiential learning, predates language & the ability to convey knowledge by means other than demonstration.\r\n* Differentiated learning - Direct instruction is expanding to include students conducting independent or guided research with multiple sources of information, greater in-class discussion, group collaboration, experiential (hands-on, project-based, etc).\r\n* Progressive education - Includes qualities such as learning by doing (hands-on projects, experiential learning, integrated curriculum, problem solving, critical thinking, group work, social skills development).\r\n* Constructivist education- It is a movement includes active learning, discovery learning, and knowledge building, and all versions promote a student\'s free exploration within a given framework or structure. The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working answering open-ended questions.\r\n* Traditional learning – To increase resources of libraries, proper space & ventilation and adequate seatings in teaching rooms, adequate instruments in lab etc.\r\n* e-learning – Providing learning & teaching resources such as searchable study guides & lecture materials, computed aided learning materials, discussion boards (both for general communication & for mediating online teaching & learning) & assessment. Large amounts of the users participation can be carried out online, being accessible –\r\n- From anywhere in the world.\r\n- At any time\r\n- At the convenience of the individual user. \r\n\r\nEffective learning environment can be achieved by – \r\n1. The students ask the questions.\r\n2. Questions are valued over answers.\r\n3. Ideas come from a divergent sources.\r\n4. A variety of learning models may be used – Inquiry based learning, project based learning, direct instruction, peer-to-peer learning, e-learning, mobile learning.\r\n5. Classroom learning empties into a connected community.\r\n6. Learning is personalized by a variety of criteria.\r\n7. Assessment is persistent, authentic, transparent & never punitive.\r\n8. Criteria for success is balanced & transparent.\r\n9. Learning habits are constantly modeled.\r\n10. There are constant opportunities for practice.\r\n\r\nHow to improve staff development program in my department (Radiology& Imaging)\r\nStaff development or faculty development has become an increasingly essential component in medical education. Staff development is a planned program designed to prepare institutions & faculty members for their various role. Now a days, virtual learning  gets a momentum to develop the environment of the institute.\r\nTarget population –\r\n1. Medical teachers\r\n2. Course coordinator / curriculum planners\r\n3. Administrator\r\n4. Organizer\r\n5. Healthcare professional\r\nApproaches-\r\nTeacher can take advantages of several types of format. Such as- \r\na. Workshops- One of the most popular formats because of their inherent flexibility & promotion of active learning.\r\nb. Seminars\r\nc. Short courses\r\nd. Consultation with professional educators\r\ne. By motivating  e-learning\r\nf. Traditional – Using libraries, study guides, lectures.\r\nFaculty members can use a variety of teaching methods within this format, including-\r\na. Interactive lectures\r\nb. Small group discussion & exercise.\r\nBased on changing needs & priorities, alternative formats are also be considered that include-\r\n1. Self directed learning\r\n2. Microteaching\r\n3. Peer coaching\r\n4. Mentoring\r\n5. Feedback from learners\r\n6. Videotape review\r\n7. Self evaluation\r\n8. Computer aided instruction.\r\n\r\n• Integrated longitudinal programme- In this programme, faculty members allocate 10-20% of their working hours for improving their educational knowledge & skills while maintaining the other activities.\r\n• Peer coaching – Key element of peer coaching includes the identification of individual learning  goals (improving specific teaching skills), focused observation of teaching by colleague & the provision of feedback, analysis & support.\r\n• Mentoring – A mentor is someone who has done helping someone who is just starting to do.

It is more important in medical science. The primary aim of\r\nmedical education is to make a safe doctor. \r\nSomeone might  give emphasis on\r\nthe humanitarian quality , but if we think about the ward safety deeply, we can\r\n  understand \r\nit encompass   everything  in achieving potentials to become a good\r\ndoctor. Teachers or facilitators   who are involved  in this process is an important factor to\r\ntransfer batons of morality & clinical acumen to future generation. But we\r\nare to remember   that only human being\r\ncannot help the  learners   to\r\nreach the all objectives of   education.\r\nAvailability of adequate logistics & infrastructure   of the teaching environment are  also \r\nequally important.<o></o></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> In ancient time as\r\ndescribed in MOHAVAROT the learners usually stayed in house of the teacher as a\r\nfamily member & GURU or the teacher taught the intended subject for which\r\nthe student or SISHYA came.

Faculty members should know which domain of learning should\r\nget priority in developing themselves to attain the goal of objectives. Staffs\r\nspecially those who are giving technical support to the learners are to improve\r\nthemselves according to the need of course and curriculum. If these peoples are\r\nprofessional  then time could be saved in\r\nthe course. Again grading the learners also important in staff development\r\nprogramme, as for example teachers when facilitates a 3<sup>rd</sup> year\r\nclinical clerking will not be same with 5<sup>th</sup> year students.

They are doing the things\r\nalready in their settings,  so actually\r\nmuch of adult learning is relearning, in a structured way. Other factors that\r\nare to be considered in adult staff development programme  are motivation, expectation, experience  of learners may not go with a prefixed seat\r\nprogramme. It has to be tailored according to local culture and situation. For\r\nassessing developmental  learning,   feedback is more effective then test so this\r\nis to be practiced in course. \r\nInteractive lecture, small group discussion, self directed learning,\r\nmicroteaching, E learning, feed back from learners and many other modality\r\ncould be included in curriculum \r\naccording to needs & priorities.<o></o></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b> FACILITATORS, ADMINISTRATORS, & TECHNICAL\r\nSTAFFS.<o></o></b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Though all are involved in providing good educational\r\nenvironment , we are more concerned about the facilitators/ teachers.

It is a\r\ncomplex multidimensional activities generally observed in senior experienced\r\nfaculty.  In  the discipline of surgery mentoring could be\r\na good model in learning process. As surgery needs craftsmanship, demands  humanitarian approach in management of\r\nterminally ill surgical patients, to have patience in facing surgical\r\ncomplications ,major trauma, breaking bad news of malignancy, to develop\r\nmanagarial  capacity in the ward, to\r\nhave  an exceptional  skill in communication regarding  informed consent; mentor ship development may\r\nhelp in meeting demand of all  these.\r\nSpecially in learning the technicalities of safe skill a mentor can help a less\r\nexperienced junior in learning .<o></o></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">Disadvantage of this system is that a\r\nmentor can’t  be instantly made &   there\r\nis no structured curriculum to become a mentor.

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (114, 83, 'Online learning environment and Continuing professional development', 'Online environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment.  \r\nComputing and the internet are merely the latest instances of technology use in education, and their novelty still attracts a distinct label of ‘electronic learning’ or, more typically ‘e-learning’. In its broadest sense, e-learning is the use of the internet for education. E-learning, often referred to as online learning encompasses a pedagogical approach that typically aspires to be flexible, engaging and learner centered; one that encourages interaction, and collaboration and communication, often asynchronously.\r\n A classroom setting and an online learning environment can be compared; both can serve the purpose of learning in particular way. We have to attend class physically, but in online course module, notes, e-mail messages and postings to discussion area read without being physically present. Research, participate in discussions (reading, responding and post to discussion area or chat room), collaboration with other students, asking questions (e-mail and/or post question in discussion area), submit assignments (via e-mail or the discussion topic with or without attachments), complete quizzes and exams, network / socialize with classmates all these are possible not only in traditional class but also in e-learning environment. The exciting thing about the online environment is that you can still do many of the usual ‘classroom’ activities - and at a place that is convenient for you. \r\nAttending class in online learning environment is primarily an asynchronous environment – that is, we don\'t have to log on to the computer at exactly the same time as our instructor or classmates in order to attend class. We will however, have specific deadlines to meet for the reading assignments and learning activities. \r\nCourse content is provided within the online course. We have the option of reading this information while online, or printing the information and reading it later. Additional information may also be provided in the form of links to other valuable web sites, articles or textbook. Just as in a face-to-face classroom setting, our comprehension of information will be assessed. Assessment may be accomplished through the use of discussion questions, self-tests, case studies, role plays, etc.\r\nIn a classroom setting, the instructor may often pose a question. In many cases, the question leads to a serious discussion and/or debate with other students. This occurs in the online classroom through the use of discussion topics in the discussion area. One of the best features of an online discussion is that we don\'t have to be present at exactly the same time in order to communicate with other members of this course. The online discussion environment uses topics and threads to organize conversations. A linked series of comments is called a discussion thread and each topic can contain several threads. \r\nOnline learning gives us an opportunity to share our discoveries with others, and learn from them. There will be times when we may need to work in small groups. Each member of the group will research and read specific information and share this with the other group members. Discussion topics are one way to collaborate online. We can also use e-mail to collaborate. Online courses have their own email package built right in so that only the students enrolled in the course can send and receive an e-mail message. Role plays and case studies may be used in online courses in order to provide us with real-life problems. Often, the discussion forum will be used to enable us solve these problems individually and with other classmates. \r\nThe instructor usually knows when we are confused or frustrated simply by our body language. In the online environment, the instructor cannot see this type of body language. This means that we must communicate when we don\'t understand! We can use the email within the course to send questions to our instructor or post our question in the discussion area for all to see. We can also ask other classmates questions just as we would in a classroom setting. Our classmates come with a wealth of knowledge from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. Use the discussion topic to post a question for all to see or send a private email to a specific individual. Either way, communication is key. \r\nIn a classroom setting, classmates typically meet before or after class for a cup of coffee and a bit of socializing. This can still occur in the online environment using e-mail, the discussion area or chat rooms. Everyone likes know a bit about the people they are studying with. One of our first activities may be to post a profile. Sharing personal profiles makes the class more enjoyable and enables us to feel more connected while learning at a distance. So all these discussion leads to the conclusion that “Online environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment”  \r\n\r\n E-learning For Continuing Professional Development.\r\nProfessionals in hundreds of fields must meet continuing education requirements to stay current in their fields and to maintain their professional licenses or certifications.  E-Learning is a great fit for continuing education because busy working professionals can fit it into their schedules more easily than traditional classroom courses. \r\nDesigning effective eLearning for continuing education is not so different from designing effective eLearning for anyone else. We should focus on some points though. First, give the learners a heads up on the system and technical support before asking them to log in. Second, make sure their organizations can give them the time and resources they need to learn. Third, keep the interfaces as simple as possible so learners can focus on the content. Fourth, balance theoretical and practical materials. Fifth, include a traditional end-of-course test when possible. And finally, give them an opportunity to connect with other professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. https://www.bcit.ca/files/distance/pdf/bcitonlinelearning.pdf \r\n2. https://elearningindustry.com/continuing-professional-development-elearning-6-best-practices\r\n3.

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (116, 86, 'Title: Online environment is merely an extension of face-to-face learning environment - why? Describe the process of e-learning and its role in continuing professional development', 'Introduction:\r\n In just few years, electronic (e) learning has become part of the mainstream in medical education. While e-learning means many things to many people, at its heart it is about the educational uses of technology. Educational technologies can be used in support of virtually any aspect of medical education. E- Learning, e- teaching and e- assessment are related but distinct areas of activity. Integrated e- learning systems in the form of virtual learning environment (VLE) or learning management systems are now the norm.\r\nE-learning: In its broadest sense, e-learning is the use of internet for education. e-learning, often referred as online learning, is not simply a broadcast of documents in electronic format to students via internet rather e-learning encompasses a pedagogical approach that typically aspires to be flexible, engaging and learner-centered, one that encourages interaction (staff-staff, staff-student and student-student) and collaboration and communication, often asynchronously (though not exclusively so). \r\ne-learning: content and process\r\nThe ‘process vs. content’ assumes a particular meaning and significance in e-learning, whether the predominant focus should be on digital content or on the digitally mediated process. If an online course or programme is primarily about participating in activity, then the focus is more likely to be on scheduling, discussion and tracking activity, with content management being a relatively small part of system. Virtual learning environment (VLE) can be used for the purpose.\r\nThe content of online learning is not exhaustive. Course materials are perhaps the most common content considered in e-learning. Also included contents are e-library, commercial e-learning contents and uncountable online websites. \r\nSystems: LMS, VLE and MLE\r\nThe most common approach in e-learning or online learning is to use an integrated suite of tools and services typically called learning management system &#40;LMS&#41;, course management system &#40;CMS&#41; or VLE\r\nVLE functions and services\r\nThe common functions, tools and services of VLE are as follows, but all of them may not be suitable for a single course-\r\n Supporting resources such as syllabus or course outline\r\n Links to additional learning contents\r\n Key words for guiding e-learners to search online learning materials\r\n Discussion boards (forums)\r\n Chat rooms for synchronous communication\r\n Blogs\r\n Online examinations and tests (quiz)\r\n Portfolio tools\r\n Other online tools/resources\r\n Scheduling (calendaring/timetabling) etc.\r\n \r\nFacilitating online learning\r\nSynchronous and asynchronous text interaction\r\nOnline facilitation typically uses bulletin boards or chat rooms as the point of contact between students and facilitators. Many of the principles of face-to-face teaching and learning also apply here. In synchronous formal question and answer session, students and staff on line are actually in a scenario of lecture theatre. All participate in common issue, usually first raised by the facilitator. Informal asynchronous activities like queries around specific course content are also important component.\r\nAudio conferencing, video conferencing and web conferencing\r\nMultimedia alternatives are growing rapidly and increasingly being used in on line learning as important and growing educational media examples are video conferencing, web conferencing and audio conferencing.\r\nFace-to-face learning vs. online learning\r\nFace-to-face learning is the oldest, most conventional and traditional method used for teaching learning activity. It allows learners to interact with lecturer and peers, exchange views and ideas. It requires commonness in time, place and interest (as applicable) of the course, learners, facilitators and supporting staff, requires administrative and logistic supports, human and monitory resources. Barrier of traditional methods include family commitment, inability to get locum coverage, distance to travel, cost of attending courses and increased workload. On the other hand, on line environment, if up to the mark, can provide almost all components of face-to-face learning. It saves time. Video and web conferencing are almost face-to-face interaction among learners and teachers and are able to remove limitations of other on line techniques. Important is that, the learners and teachers are to have some computer literacy, have to have own computer, on line access, administrators are to provide and update information etc. The security of the whole matter is also important.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nEvery method in teaching learning activity has its inherent merits and demerits. One is not better than other in all perspectives; rather one should be complimentary to the other. So, on line teaching environment should be regarded as extension of face-to-face learning environment.\r\ne-learning and its role in continuing professional development\r\nDefinition of continuing professional development\r\nContinuing professional development (CPD) is the systematic maintenance, improvement and broadening of knowledge and the development of personal qualities necessary for the education of professionals throughout the working life. CPD is a broader concept including essential reference to the personal and social aspects of medical practice needed for high quality professional performance in modern health care delivery system.\r\nImportance of CPD\r\nCPD in medical education is simply required for good medical practice. CPD is important for its relevance in professional success, because-\r\n It helps in improving competence (skills and knowledge)\r\n To maintain up to date standard \r\n Maintain quality of care\r\n\r\nMethods for CPD\r\n Formal: conference, workshop, lectures, etc.\r\n Informal: short-term placements, etc.\r\n\r\nFollowing types of learning are now recognized as part of CPD\r\n Distance and open learning\r\n Computer based learning\r\n Computer assisted learning\r\n Problem oriented learning including self-management learning\r\n Structured learning including articles\r\n Writing technical reports\r\n Part time teaching\r\n Membership of relevant professional committee\r\n Skill development\r\n Short-term placements\r\n\r\ne-learning and CPD\r\nIt is obvious that for maintaining the standards of medical care, physicians are to be up to date in knowledge and skills. Aside from the formal CPD, practitioners are to be familiar with the current development in global scenario. Without using e-learning it is impossible to remain up to date. So, like formal CPD, on line or use of e-learning in CPD is important.\r\nConclusion\r\nCPD is an indispensible part of a professional and e-learning is probably the most important learning method in CPD.\r\n', '2018-02-09 02:07:56', 'upload/attachment/2d2c0a0ab1a83ad7a38c0b3b41ea14c6.docx', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Organized- as traditional curriculum with basic sciences first and applied science with clinical medicine next. It will be better to start integrated teaching from the very beginning of the M.B.B.S. course.\r\niv. Contents- within the curriculum is also appropriate, but overburdened with topics regarding theory. There are appropriate practical topics as well, again needs guideline and suggestion for changes in the institutions to achieve and implement such contents (discussed below).\r\nv. Assessment system- are also very modern, but lacks diversity in questioning and feedback system due to lack of faculty training. \r\n\r\nIII. Teaching Method: \r\nTeaching methods suggested in the curriculum are very good. To practice these methods appropriately faculty training and continuing professional development are necessary.  \r\nIV. Teachers:\r\nMost of our teachers are enthusiastic and interested in quality teaching. Many of them have short, comprehensive (3days) training on medical education either in government institute or in Ibrahim Medical College (on self-payment), but none has precise training. All teachers in the department must be trained at a wider extent with medical education, contents of the curriculum and technics for their implementation and practice. A training can be started with senior teachers followed by juniors. There should have orientation program for new faculties. \r\nTeachers need to sit with students at the beginning of each compartment of clinical placement to orient them about the contents to be completed during that period what is expected of them at the end, and assessment method. \r\nV. Physical Environment:\r\ni. Library- \r\n• Our library needs expansion and modification in sitting arrangement with scope for individuals as well as group discussions.\r\n• Number of books need to be increased consisting of basic to advanced so that those who wish to build up career in surgery can be benefited since student-hood. \r\n• Electronic library- we need an electronic library with internet and its attendant resource facilities. CD and DVD on clinical examination, skill practice and different surgical procedures (basic to advanced) should be available. High quality images and sound clips are also important.\r\n• Copies of curriculum, academic calendar, time-table, study guide must be available in the library. \r\nii. Study guides- need to be made available for students mentioning objectives, contents and organization, teaching method, resources available, revision, glossary, illustrations and assessment method. \r\niii. Lectures- present practice is traditional and one-way (didactic method). We need to change/shift to interactive lecture. Students should be informed of the topic, aims and objectives, time allowed for self-study, interactive class, feedback (student to teacher, teacher to student)\r\niv. Tutorials- number of rooms need to increased and made free of distractions:\r\n• Small group- to ensure student participation and interaction, group work and reflection.\r\n• Need to be equipped with computers and audio-visual aids to facilitate teaching-learning and instant inter-active feedback.\r\nv. Clinical skill center- need to be established to avoid exclusive dependence on adhoc experience and hospital patients, equipped with models and manikins, simulated clinical environment, simulated and standardized patients (due to paucity of patients), necessary instruments. It will ensure one on one revision session and remedial training of students. \r\nvi. Procedure room- with facility of patients’ comfort and logistics, space and observation system for each student. \r\nvii. Operation theatre- traditional system of theatre placement of students has many limitations (contamination of OT environment, distractions during surgery, poor observation facilities for students). Modern facilities and space should be made available so that each student can equally observe the procedure and interact with the faculty. \r\nviii. Bedside teaching- To ensure distraction-free environment exclusive side rooms for pre/post round discussions as attendant control is almost impossible in our set-up. Presence of a nurse/student nurse during teaching to add multi-professional inputs.\r\nix. Patients- need to be briefed earlier so that they know what will be expected to them, feel a part of discussion and give feedback to students.\r\nx. Grand rounds, teaching ward round- to be started. \r\nxi. Ambulatory care teaching-need to be made more effective, extended to beyond need of examinations. \r\nxii. Log books- need to be made more effective through daily fill-up and signed by tutor. \r\nxiii. Community orientation- need to be incorporated in a short, discrete block of time through the mentorship of primary care doctors so that student can find relevance of what they been taught to be practice in real situation. \r\nxiv. Peer-assisted learning- may be started during block posting so that weaker students can feel free to learn from their friends. \r\nxv. Evidence-based medicine- at least one day in a month is devoted during clinical years of study. \r\n\r\nVI. Incorporation of DREEM- to evaluate educational environment\r\n\r\nVII. Staff development program: \r\nOur surgery department is part of two separate independent institutions (BIRDEM and IMC) with separate goals and interests of their own apart from individual faculty. BIRDEM is intended to have clinical services, IMC expects experts teaching skills, whereas, individual faculty expects successful career plan. To fulfill such outcomes many programs are run routinely and in adhoc basis in both institutes and in the department, but none have any structured program of staff development. So, we need to prepare a staff development program with goals and priorities set to balance individual and organization’s need and faculty motivation. \r\ni. Teaching skill – we need to train our teachers with comprehensive course of medical education. \r\n• Short course- available in government institute and IMC continued to be availed. Continuing medical education, one session in each month in BIRDEM need to be continued. \r\n• Peer coaching- faculties need initiatives not to soldiering on alone when other more experienced colleagues are around and are willing to assist. \r\n• Mentoring\r\n• orientation for new faculties\r\n• Scientific ethics and good practice\r\nAbove three facilities need to be newly started.\r\nii. Administrative skill- need to be started at a standard of foundation training for government officials.\r\niii. Research skill- three day short-course is available now in BIRDEM. It may be extended to a broad base so that faculties feel comfort in clinical research and scientific write-up. \r\niv. Clinical work- we have organizational (BIRDEM), departmental, unit-based practice of case presentation, mortality-morbidity meeting, and journal club run in regular basis. Our organization allows faculty members to participate in CME, workshops, seminars, and conferences at home and abroad, provide all possible support to arrange CME, workshops and seminars. These should be continued.\r\nWe need collaboration with other institutes at home and abroad with specific skill development facility so that faculties may get advanced training in respective field of clinical practice. \r\nFaculties need to have incentive in the form of credit for promotion who participates and take leadership in above programs.  \r\nv. Career planning- for junior faculties \r\nvi. Network building – our faculties are members of society and forum of their respective discipline (national and international). This need to be continued and encouraged for further extension so that they can remain updated and get ready for future advancement through active participation. \r\n\r\nVIII. Conclusion:\r\n“A medical schools most important asset is its faculty”. Academic vitality and advance clinical practice is dependent upon faculty member’s interest and expertise. We should remain innovative and flexible to accommodate the ever-changing needs of our teachers. Our institutions and the health care system in which we work. \r\n', '2018-02-10 00:37:58', 'upload/attachment/044527ed77214375a9de133edd4d5a04.docx', '<p>Dear fellow, It is well written indeed.

Describe the process of e-learning & its role in CPD.\r\n\r\nOnline environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment –\r\nDefinition of online environment – It is an educational approach, culture context & physical setting where teaching & learning occur by using ICT (Information & communication technologies).\r\nPrinciples of e-learning – E-learning (often referred to as online learning) is not simply a broadcast of documents in electronic format to students via the internet, it encompasses a pedagogical approach that typically aspires to be flexible, engaging & learner-centered; one that encourages interaction (staff-staff, staff-student, student-student) and collaboration & communication, often asynchronously (through not exclusively so). Any course that employs e-learning might be run exclusively online or might be a mixture of online & face to face activities (Blended learning).\r\nReasons of online environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment –\r\n1. The facilitator in e-learning may take the role being guide the student to work themselves through issues instead of supplying information only may take the role of the traditional facilitator.\r\n2. E-learning is now widely used in various forms of case based or problem based learning (PBL). \r\nPBL may be e-PBL or face to face e-PBL. e-PBL can be similar to standard PBL; the case is created & then distributed through e-mail or by posting into the VLE or in a system specifically designed for ePBL. Students interact with each other via chat rooms, bulletin boards, email or white boards. Face to face e-PBL is an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n3. In blended e-learning a mixture of online & face to face activities used for learning is an extension of face to face learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Audio & video – A good way for novice e-teachers to begin using audio & video is to create sound or video files that can be placed on a website or VLE for download by students. Audio conferencing using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) or tele conferencing by using skype, video conferencing & web conferencing as live lecture are extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n5. Syndicating content & casting – Audio & video files (often referred to as vodcasting) are streamed directly into the student’s device, using a format known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n6. Chat rooms are used for synchronous communication when students are dispersed but wish to attend a discussion simultaneously. Synchronous question & answer in a chat room where student & faculty meet online  as in lecture theatre as an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n7. Discussion boards in e-learning (also known as bulletin boards or forums) are a means for participants to communicate asynchronously. This means that someone posts a message & others read & post replies at some later date or time; threads of discussion thereby build up over time as an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n8. Blogs ( a shortened form of weblogs) in e-learning typically take the form of a personal online journal , usually written by one individual, but open to be read by all . Each new post is added on top of previous post is as an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\nDescribe the process of e-learning :\r\nAny learning experience supported by ICT often referring to as online learning. The term e-learning describes the use of the new electronic technologies including the internet to facilitate learning. It includes-\r\n• The online delivery of course content\r\n• Discussion forums\r\n• Online tutoring or mentoring\r\n• Bulletin boards\r\n• Synchronous communication & instant chat\r\n• Online assessment\r\n• Offline resources such as CDs & DVDs.\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n      Processes of e-learning includes –\r\n1. Schedules (Study guides)\r\n2. Rules\r\n3. Protocols\r\n4. Online discussion\r\n5. Chat\r\n6. Conferencing (Teleconferencing, skype, web conferencing, audio & video conferencing)\r\n7. By accessing specific e-learning content.\r\n8. By taking tests & assessments (Formative & summative e-assessment)\r\n9. Working through short exercise to stimulate thinking.\r\n10. Completing web forms such as those used in e-Portfolios or course evaluation.\r\n11. Communicating by email or online searching.\r\n\r\nRole of e-learning in CPD (Continuing Professional Development)\r\nCPD is a combination of approaches, techniques & ideas that will help professionals to maintain, manage continuous improvement & enhance own learning. The benefit of CPD is keeping a professional up to date with current knowledge & competence.\r\n1. E-learning is offering the ease of access, so crucial to learners.\r\n2. Online CPD (CME) is ideally suited to meet the CRISIS criteria of Convenience, Relevance, Individualization, Self assessment, Independent learning & systematic approach to learning.\r\n3. E-learning reduce the impact of the traditional CME barriers such as – family commitments, distance travel, costs of attending courses, increased workload, lack of time etc.\r\n', '2018-02-13 18:37:14', 'upload/attachment/a8f157e95561411f6271533c269469a0.docx', '<p>congratulation. your assignment is accepted. </p>', NULL, '2018-02-14 06:37:14', 'F');

Describe the process of e-learning and its role in CPD”\r\nFellow ID: 181020\r\nThe world of education has been varied by the fast and rapid revolution in computer and the Internet technologies. The arrival of World Wide Web (WWW) has increased the demand for distance education and concepts like online learning or e- learning has emerged, as a result. \r\nIn the online learning environment, teaching and learning take place through the use of computers, internet and computer mediated digital systems. It is also called the e-learning environment \r\ne-learning might be exclusively online or might be a mixture of online and face to face activities, called blended learning .\r\n\r\nOnline environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment because-\r\n• In face to face learning, there is facilitator.  Online environments also allow students to take turns as a moderator or facilitator and learn much more from the process. Online facilitation uses bulletin boards or chat rooms as the point of contact between students and facilitators.\r\n• All forms of group work requires participation. In face to face learning, this participation occurs physically in classroom, campus and in online environment they collaborate with others by reading, responding and posting messages via e-mail, chat room, and/or whiteboard\r\n• In online learning learners get to know about the course content and exam schedules by reading course module notes, e-mail messages and postings to discussion area.\r\n• In a classroom setting, the instructor may often pose a question. In many cases, the question leads to a serious discussion and debate with other students. This also occurs in the online classroom through the use of discussion topics in the discussion area by audio, video and web conferencing by the use of skype, MSN . \r\n• In online learning, e-assessment is taken by the use of ICT for authoring, delivering, marking, providing feedback and analyzing of both formative and summative student assessment.\r\n• In a classroom setting, classmates typically meet before or after class for a cup of coffee and a bit of socializing. This can still occur in the online environment using e-mail, the discussion area or chat rooms. Everyone likes know a bit about the people they are studying with.\r\n• There are also e-Logistics and e- administration which support the administration and logistics of learning environment\r\nMany of the principles of face to face teaching and learning also apply to online learning environment. Many technological tools and different social media devices  minimize the distance between students and to make online classes as interesting as face-to-face ones.\r\nAs seen, e-learning can be as great as the face-to face learning environment. These facts show that students will be more benefited from online classes if the course is a blend of online and face- to face learning, then one can easily emphasise that “Online environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment”.\r\nProcess of e-learning:\r\nThe process of e-learning begins with a comprehensive analysis of learners, learning content, and context and ends with performing a quality check. The e-learning process includes several stages: analysis, planning, design, development, delivery, and evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\ne-learning process can be divided into two major phases:\r\n1) Content preparation\r\n2) Content implementation \r\nContent preparation\r\nContent preparation phase consists of activities including analysis, planning, design, development and evaluation.\r\nIn analysis stage learning goals and objectives are established and learner’s knowledge and skills are identified. It is a broad process.\r\nOn the basis of analysis stage, a comprehensive e- learning plan can be developed and it serves as road map.\r\nThe design of e- learning follows a logical and orderly method of organizing course contents with learning objectives, relevant learning strategies, assessment instruments, exercise and delivery media.\r\nContent implementation \r\nDuring the implementation phase all e-content is distributed to or is accessible by its stakeholder groups at anytime from anywhere in the world. In this phase, all e-learning content is uploaded to the server (usually all e-content is hosted on LMSs - Learning Management Systems or LCMSs). \r\nAll supplemental course materials (e.g., CD, DVD, audio and video cassette, book, course pack, etc.) are also delivered to its stakeholder groups. Before offering an e-learning course to its target population, an institution should have an efficient administrative system to register students, experienced technical support system to maintain and update e-learning content. \r\nInstitution should have a procedure for training instructors and facilitators on course curriculum, learning outcomes, method of delivery, and testing procedures. Similar procedures should be in place for technical and other support staff and students.\r\nInstitution must employ a system of updating and monitoring of all e-learning materials on a regular basis. During this stage it is critical that all internal and external links and resources are active, and all security measures are in place.\r\nRole of e-learning in CPD-\r\nContinuing professional development (CPD) involves not only educational activities to enhance medical competence in medical knowledge and skills, but also in management, team building, professionalism, interpersonal communication, technology, teaching, and accountability.\r\nIt is an ongoing process and continues throughout a professional’s career. \r\nThe traditional method of CPD are face -to- face courses, seminars or it may be informal, such as reading of journals and texts, which are not always possible. Traditional CPD include family commitments, lack of time, distances to travel and increased work load. e-learning can play very important role to overcome these barriers. \r\n e-learning-\r\n• Provides online courses on CPD\r\n• Makes the course convenient \r\n• Makes the course schedule and environment flexible \r\n• Makes the course relevant\r\n• Provides individual, independent learning approach\r\n• Provides systematic learning approach\r\n• Provides opportunity of self assessment and feedback\r\n• Save time for other professional and personal activities\r\n• Maintains privacy and confidentiality of the learner\r\nTraditional method along with e-learning can make the CPD successful. Every doctor has a personal responsibility to participate in continuing professional development. Institutions should accept responsibility for both CME and CPD of doctors, establish effective CPD schemes and strategies to meet the needs of doctors, the populations they serve, and the organizations where they work.                                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-02-13 22:07:24', 'upload/attachment/1f60cb9553be2b571a0e4357fe2414c9.doc', '<p>Dear fellow</p><p>Your assignment accepted.

It has many pros and cons. Online (OL) learning is a new system of teaching learning first introduced in 2002 and rapidly gaining acceptance. It has many advantages over traditional learning, but not also without limitations. Blending system including both traditional and online are complementary and provide maximum benefits to the learners. When considered together online learning environment provide support as an extension of service that is provided by face-to-face (FtF) learning environment. There are many causes as mentioned below:\r\n1. Traditional learning environment provide age oriented learning opportunity from primary school through to university level. There are little or no scope of on-campus learning facility for elderly people who feel to keep learning out of boredom or curiosity. OL learning environment provides various courses for them.\r\n2. Not all students can avail facility of traditional learning because of medical condition or disability. They can avail OL courses for study. \r\n3. Some learners need school transfer due to change of locations of parents’ job. They can avail OL learning to continue with the same school from their new location. \r\n4. Those who are doing job, continue learning OL with same academic calendar as their institutions that provide courses. They can take classes at their time they wish. \r\n5. Traditional learning provides much life experiences and OL also provides experience from discussion forum, synchronous communication and instant chat.\r\n6. FtF learning provides more value to college degree, allow to meet service providers who hires alumni from college, whereas, OL provide with special service oriented skills which also help to get job. FtF allows access to equipment and facilities to improve knowledge about a subject in a campus. OL focus on improving skill and make marketable leading to polished and development of job related skills. \r\n7. FtF give general critical thinking skill but may not get hands on experience of what you learn. Thus get tough to do a task in professional life, whereas, OL helps in such situation with relevant skills about subject. \r\n8. FtF is expensive, OL cuts off expenditure to a half and thus allows learners to continue study. \r\n9. Those engaged in FtF and travel extensively need not interruption of study if OL facilities are available in his institutes.\r\n10. In FtF tutors are available to interact to teach to assess and to provide feedback and in OL learners can contact tutors when needed instantly, also has the opportunity of self-assessment.\r\n11. FtF learning is directed by teachers/supervisors/guides and learners become self-dependent, self-regulated and self-directed in OL environment. \r\nThus where FtF stops/limits its service OL environment continue with the learners to solve the limitations. \r\nAssignment-2\r\nDescribe the Process of E-learning (EL) and its Role in Continuing Professional Development (CPD)\r\nThere are some common phases that any EL development process must undergo. There are a fair number of instructional design modules. Whatever module is chosen, the module itself is followed quite rigidly. In EL each organization follows its own process that fits into its way of functioning. There are some common faces that are followed. These are:\r\n1. Creation of instructional design (IDD)- This is a high level plan of overall instructional approaches of the course. Some approaches are problem-solving, avatars and scenarios. It is also decided how the content need to be broken down to courses, modules and scenarios. Each course is to be created using a different IDD strategy, dealt with in the IDD. Instructional and visual elements are finalized.\r\n2. Scripting- Contents of each course is broadly finalized and divided into modules and the content for each screen within each module is decided on. Interactivities, assessment, activities and resources for each module are finalized. Narrative script is finalized. Form of script may be word document of power-point presentations.\r\n3. Development of a prototype- This is a complete representation of entire course in a few slides. On screen content and audio scripts are created and finalized. Important elements are picked up for the course and a functional prototype is created. Final decision is made about how contents will be presented on screen, interactivities, activities/assignments added, colors, images, animations and additional resources provided. The prototype needs to be functional on the learning management system.\r\n4. Development of the course without audio- Fully functional course is made ready and approved without audio. May need changes in content, narration, and animation etc. before approval. \r\n5. Development of the course audio- Audio script is finalized, synchronized with animations and on screen text and fully functioning course with audio is ready. \r\n6. Creation of learning management system version- This is the final step is mostly mechanical and technical one. Once get the final approval the course is ready to be hosted on the learning platform and go “live”. Technical take care at this stage. \r\nEach face of the process of EL development need approval before going to the next step. Thus at the end of the day a successful course is created and learners get a course that helps them learn. \r\nRole of EL in CPD\r\nEL has the potential in the delivery of CPD services online. Professionals are time constrained and price sensitive, naturally strong independent learners making them good candidates for EL services. \r\n1. EL provides customized or personalized curriculum that is needed by individual students. \r\n2. Learning is made available at a time and place that is optimal for the learner.\r\n3. Provide access to teachers and resources from any place at any time world-wide.\r\n4. Learners work together more closely and more meaningfully.\r\n5. Access to interactive content.\r\n6. Access to simulations, ability to rehearse scenarios and procedures thus accelerate expertise.\r\nThe followings are the primary service components for OL CPD:\r\n1. Personal development planner\r\n2. CPD port folio tracker\r\n3. EL course delivery\r\n4. Supporting resource banks \r\n\r\n', '2018-02-12 19:00:11', 'upload/attachment/c77c66f6d25086ce85123bc0a5d30d65.docx', '<p>welldone</p>', NULL, '2018-02-13 07:00:11', 'F');

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (136, 106, 'Title: Differentiating teaching from instruction using suitable examples. Prepare an instructional text for your students of your own discipline following the rules of instructional design theory', 'Introduction\r\nInstruction is a human activity and its purpose is to help people learn. Instruction is a set of events which affect learner in such a way that learning is ultimately facilitated like enzyme acts as biocatalyst. The conception of teaching is not about transmitting information or imparting knowledge but about facilitating student learning. Instruction may be a printed page, picture, television program or combination of any physical objects. Teaching although consider as one form of instruction but it is the single most important one among all other instructions. A handout on contents in topic “UTI” may be supplied to students containing reading lists including definition, aetiology, clinical features, investigations and treatment, which is an instruction and a later taken lecture class (teaching learning session) on UTI may be an example of teaching.\r\nSo, Instruction is a broad heading under which teaching is a form of instruction which facilitates learning.\r\n                                                                     My instructional text on UTI \r\nInstructional design theories concerned with arranging external events that support internal process of the learner to achieve learning outcome .Every teacher should have specific and detailed knowledge of the intent and purpose of each of the instructional events. There are several instructional design theories of these; Robert Gagne proposed a series of events which follow a systematic instructional design process that share the behaviorist approach to learning with a focus on the outcome of instruction or training\r\nThe following nine steps have been adapted from Gagne, Briggs, and Wager (1992)\r\n1. Gaining attention: The purpose of this event is to focus learners on the tasks to be learned by presenting an interesting event, telling a relevant story or showing a picture. It is important to remember that attention must be maintained throughout the session for effective learning\r\n2. Inform the learning objective- it is important because the learners need to know what they are to learn and to achieve\r\nObjective-\r\na. Definition of UTI\r\nb.  common organisms causing UTI\r\nc. Pathophysiology\r\nd. Diagnosis\r\ne. Management and\r\nf. Follow up\r\n3. Stimulate recall of prior learning- help students make sense of new information by relating it to something they already know or something they have already experienced.\r\nMethods for stimulating recall include:\r\n Have you seen the patient of UTI?\r\n Ask few common questions like why female are more prone to UTI? \r\n What is the most common organism?\r\n4. Present the content- it is considered as the core of teaching. In this event, the fact, the concept and principles of learning to be focused in a structured way so, that learner can understand. Same content of instruction of multiple version provide added facilitation e.g. video, demonstration. In sometime use a variety of media to address different learning preferences.\r\n5. Provide learning guidance- advice students of strategies to aid them in learning content and of                        resources available.\r\n Methods to provide learning guidance include: \r\n-Provide instructional support as needed-as scaffold (cues, hints, prompt) which can be    removed after they learn the task or content.\r\n-Model varied learning strategies-mnemonics, concept mapping, role playing\r\n-Use examples and non-examples\r\n6. Elicit performance (practice) – this event provides the occasion for learners to practice or checks that the students have learned\r\n Ways to activate learner processing include: \r\n-Elicit student activities - palpate the lower abdomen, elicit renal angle whether tender or not \r\n-Elicit recall strategies-ask them to recite, revisit or reiterate information they have learned\r\n- Help them integrate new knowledge\r\n7. Providing feedback on performance-feedback for student very much essential for learning. It help student for assessing performance as well as facilitate learning. There are different type of feedback\r\n-Confirmatory feedback-Inform the student they did what he/she were suppose to do.\r\n-Corrective and remedial feedback- Inform the student the accuracy of their performance     or response\r\n-Remedial feedback-Directs students in the right direction to find the correct answer but does not provide the correct answer\r\n-Informative feedback-Provides information (New, different, addition or suggestions) for listening as well as sharing between them\r\n-Analytical feedback- provide the student with suggestions, recommendations and information for them to correct their performance\r\n8. Assessing the performance-is concerned with complete demonstration of learning outcomes at the end of instruction. It conform that the learning has taken place. For expected complete learning we must test to see improvement  \r\nMethods for testing learning include:  \r\n -Conduct a post test to check for mastery of content or skills\r\n-Include objective or criterion-referenced performances which measure how well a student has    learned a topic\r\n-Identify a normative-referenced performance which compares one student to another student\r\n9. Enhance retention and transfer to job- to help learners develop expertise, they must internalize new knowledge  \r\nConclusion: Ganges nine event of instruction can help build the framework with which to prepare and deliver instructional content. Ideally we should prepare course goals and learning objectives before implementing the nine events. The nine events of instruction can then be modified to fit both the content to be presented and student’s level of knowledge.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n', '2018-02-22 01:31:59', 'upload/attachment/435f3f4ad91496e96ae0a6d500ee9ce6.docx', '<p>Your overall writing is very good but if you write instructional text for your student, following the style I have attached here would be even better.

In achieving this, the process of instructional design is significant. \r\nTeaching almost always implies having a teacher. Instruction can come from a piece of paper or a book. Teaching is more complex in nature. When we talk about teaching, we are dealing with different techniques, strategies, and approaches that will facilitate learning. Teachers have to come up with varied instructional materials and must use the right strategies in teaching their lessons. \r\nTeaching is also a never ending process. By the time individuals start going to school to the time they graduate and start working, they\'re involved in the teaching-learning process. They don\'t only learn from teachers but also from those around them. \r\nThis makes teaching both formal and informal. It is formal when it occurs inside the classroom or informal when you learn things outside the portals of the school. For instance, we learn to read and write in school with the help of your teachers. On the other hand, our parents teach us informally about living life and correct values. \r\nWhen we talk about instruction, it\'s not as complex as teaching. Instruction is simply giving direction. We instruct someone on what to do and how to do it. For instance, in school we\'re given instructions by our teachers on how to answer a test or how to perform an experiment. After which, we\'re simply left to do our work on our own. \r\nInstruction makes learners dependent on the teacher. We\'re told what to do and oftentimes, there are steps we need to follow. Instructions must be understood and followed strictly in order to accomplish a particular task. Once we fail to do so, we won\'t be able to finish the task correctly. \r\nTeaching and instruction go together especially in education. Both are needed in helping people learn and develop as individuals.\r\nInstructional text for students (Bipolar mood disorder)\r\n1.

Prepare an instructional text for your students following the rules of instructional design theory (your own discipline).\r\n\r\nTeaching is the process of attending to people\'s needs, experiences and feelings, and making specific interventions to help them learn particular things. It is the imparting of knowledge by a teacher or other knowledgeable person.\r\nInstruction is vital for education, as it is the transfer of learning from one person to another. Any time we are given directions or told how to do something we are receiving instruction.\r\nThe noun instruction is related to the word structure. Effective instruction is presented in an orderly, structured manner.\r\nTeaching and learning usually involve instruction. Teachers have to come up with varied instructional materials and must use the right strategies in teaching their lessons. \r\n\r\n         Differentiation between teaching and instruction are given below:\r\n We can teach almost anything: concepts, ideas, theories but when we instruct someone, we are giving them a set of tools or tasks to do something specific.\r\n Teaching works for overall development while specific instruction works for specific domain development. \r\nFor example-\r\n In heat coagulation test, the instructions are-\r\n• Objective- it is done to detect protein in urine\r\n• Materials and method\r\n• Comments\r\nBut from the point of view of teaching, we can say many things about heat coagulation test other than instruction. Suppose, we can define and classify proteinuria, mention other methods of detection of protein in urine, explain the changes happen to protein after heat coagulation test and many more things.\r\n Teaching is bi-directional but instruction is uni-directional. For example, teachers form their lesson plan on a topic according to instruction but when they apply this lesson plan in class it becomes teaching and they get learner’s response\r\n Teaching is more complex in nature. When we talk about teaching, we are dealing with different techniques, strategies, and approaches that will facilitate learning. \r\nInstruction, is not as complex as teaching. Instruction makes the teaching easy. Instruction is simply giving direction. We instruct someone on what to do and how to do it. \r\nFor instance, in medical college students are given instructions by their teachers on how to answer a test or how to perform an experiment. \r\n Teaching is also a never ending process. We don\'t only learn from teachers but also from those around us. This makes teaching both formal and informal. It is formal when it occurs inside the classroom or informal when you learn things outside the portals of the educational institute.\r\nIn educational environment, Instruction is always formal and given by the teacher or facilitator by various ways like lecture notes, handouts, power point, overhead projector etc.\r\nIn teaching, Instructions must be understood and followed strictly in order to accomplish a particular task. Once we fail to do so, we won\'t be able to finish the task correctly. \r\nTeaching and instruction go together especially in education. Both are needed in helping people learn and develop as individual.\r\n\r\nI am from Biochemistry discipline and my instructional text for my students following the rules of instructional design theory are given below:\r\n\r\nTopic: Concept of Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrate\r\nIntroduction:\r\nGain attention \r\nTo gain attention, I raise questions like,\r\n To get energy what we intake? (We intake carbohydrate. It is ingested in complex form) \r\n  Can they tell the name of the process that makes this complex carbohydrate in simpler form after ingestion and make it suitable for absorption? (It is digestion)\r\nInform the learning objectives\r\nAt the end of the session the students will be able to:\r\n1. Name the dietary carbohydrates\r\n2.

Introduction:\r\nLearning is facilitated by teaching. The teacher has to communicate with learners for effective teaching. Instruction acts as a means of communication among teacher and learners in a systematic way. \r\n\r\n2. Teaching:\r\nTeaching may be defined as an organized communication between the teachers and the students, concerned with providing students with opportunities to learn. It encompasses course design, course management and methods of teaching, provision of other learning opportunities, assessment and feedback of students. It is an intentional activity and interactive process among teacher, student and tasks. \r\nTeacher’s concept of teaching vary greatly, some are happy to ‘covering the subject’, others claim that they are ‘imparting information’ and still others are ‘imparting knowledge’. They emphasis on the content of the subject and their teaching of it. This type of teaching is ‘teachers-centered’ and content oriented. In this process, the student will get a sufficient grasp of the subject to be able to answer the questions raised in an examinations in the form of recall of factual information. Here learning is often thought as a single uniform process, there are little or no distinction made between “learning to load a rifle and learning to solve a complex mathematical problem”. \r\nThis trend is changing, now there are teachers who are facilitating student learning, adopt an approach to teaching that is “student-centered and learning oriented”. \r\n\r\n3. Instruction:\r\nFor effective teaching, the teacher has to communicate with the learners. Instructional materials act as means of communicating ideas from the teacher to the learners, thus help to achieve learning goals. Instructional design can be considered as a process through which teacher can identify the nature of the learning that is intended to take place, work out an approach to teaching that will facilitate the achievement of that learning and administer an appropriate assessment that will determine whether the intended learning has taken place. Instructions may be defined as “the set of plannred external events which influence the process of learning and thus promote learning” (Robert Gangne). In this process the student is encourage to adopt “deep approach” to learning and its expected to understand and apply the knowledge acquired. \r\nThe steps of the instruction include need assessment, objective, medium, implementation and evaluation. There is an interaction among the components of instruction- learner characteristics, objective, methods, and evaluation. Revision of evaluation guide to review or set new objectives and nature of instruction. There are various theories of instruction which are concerned with arranging external events that supports internal process of learning to achieve learning outcome on the basis of understanding of how students learn. These theories provide guidelines for organizing the activities teachers should do (external to mind) that influence on inside the learner’s mind (internal to mind), so that they can learn easily. Thus teaching-learning is made more structured and effective to achieve the learning objectives. \r\n\r\n4. Example\r\nA teacher prepare a power point presentation in his laptop on the topic ‘Acute Appendicitis’ including introduction, anatomy (with microscopy), acute appendicitis, etiology, pathology, clinical diagnosis (history, symptoms, clinical signs), differential diagnosis (according to age), investigation, treatment, appendisectomies and their consequences with management. He used multimedia to deliver the lecture in the class using that power point presentation, provided necessary explanation, showed relevant pictures and video clips, asked questions to assess students’ understanding and retention. \r\nAn instructor provided instructions on ‘Acute Appendicitis’. He gained attention of the students by saying the story of Appendicitis of one of his friend when he was college student, then he informed the learning objectives of acute appendicitis, initiated discussions by asking questions to assess pre-requisite knowledge like ‘what are the different anatomical positions of the appendix’, then proceed to the topic ‘Appendicitis’, provided guidelines, allowed group discussions, showed diagnostic physical examinations and asked students to practice, provided feedback on examination and assessed their performances. Finally he summarized the whole topic and concluded with the advice to go through some books. \r\n\r\n5. Conclusion:\r\nThe purpose of teaching is to facilitate learning. The instructional design process is a valuable and comprehensive aid in this task since it involves the identification of nature of learning that is intended to take place. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssignment-2\r\nPrepare an Instructional Text for Your Students following the Rules of Instructional Design Theory\r\n\r\nTitle:\r\nEliciting rebound tenderness in a patient with acute appendicitis.\r\n1.

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (179, 141, ' Skeletal Handout on \"Dealing with Challenging Patients\"', 'Dealing with Challenging Patients \r\n\r\nViolence against doctors is an increasing problem. \r\n \r\nThe most at risk are-\r\n Doctors working in emergency departments, \r\n General practitioners, \r\n Psychiatrists, and  \r\n Doctors in training.\r\n\r\nDoctors could be spat at, kicked, punched, bitten, or even stabbed by patients or their relatives/friends. One in three of the doctors physically assaulted is injured, 5% seriously.\r\nOver a 12 month period 63% of family physicians had some experience of violence, while 18% experienced some sort of abuse at least once a month. (In a city in UK, 1991)\r\nThere is no proper training of health care professionals on how to handle the challenging situation.\r\n Patients, and sometimes their attendants show challenging behavior that may take the form of:\r\n• Being demanding or controlling \r\n• Unwillingness to listen/uncooperative\r\n• Verbal abuse or threats\r\n• Physical violence against people or property.\r\n Most people who are violent have a mental disorder\r\n              True / False?\r\n              Why ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do patients become ‘challenging’?\r\nUnwell or in pain\r\nDrink/substance misuse\r\nFear, anxiety or distress\r\nCommunication or language difficulties\r\nUnrealistic expectations \r\nPrevious poor experience\r\nFrustration & Guilt  \r\n   \r\nTo Identifying the problem, Questions are-\r\n Is it the patient?\r\n    Medical/ Psychiatric problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Is it lack of resources?\r\n     Long waiting times/lack of available appointments or beds/poor communication by staff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Is it the doctor?\r\n      Competing pressures on the doctor (time, resources, personal) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Challenging patients\r\n If physical/medical cause suspected: \r\nSedative medication for proper examination, \r\nActive medical management & transfer \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n If psychiatric cause suspected: \r\nPharmacological management, \r\nCompulsory detention, review current management & transfer for proper care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n If no physical or psychiatric cause suspected: Inform security or police to have person removed.\r\n When the person has offensive weapon/ a hostage situation/threatening suicide:  \r\nThis is a police matter & our responsibility does not extend to risking own or other people’s lives in trying to deal with the situation.\r\n\r\nBefore interviewing we always have to consider:  \r\n• Self-protection\r\n• Have proper interview setup including others in the vicinity.\r\n• Have others present during the assessment if needed.\r\n• Know as much as possible about the patients before meeting them.\r\n• Attend to developing an alliance with the patient.\r\n• Reassure, calm or assist the patient’s reality testing.\r\n• Offer medication to control aggressiveness.\r\n• Inform the patient that restraint or seclusion will be used if necessary.\r\n• Have teams ready to restrain the patient.\r\n• Leave physical restraint procedures to those who are trained.\r\n• Immediately plan a further approach.\r\n• Use of restraints-\r\n\r\n1. Preferably five or a minimum of four persons should be used to restrain the patient. \r\n2. Leather restrains are the safest and surest type of restraints.\r\n3. Explain to the patient why he or she is going into restraints. \r\n4. Patient should be restrained with legs spread eagled and one arm restrained to one side and the other arm restrained over patient’s head.\r\n \r\n\r\n5. The patient’s head is raised slightly to decrease the patient’s feelings of vulnerability & the possibility of aspiration.\r\n6. A staff member should always be visible and reassuring the patient who is being restrained.\r\n7. Restrains should be placed so that intravenous fluids can be given, if necessary. \r\n8. The restrains should be checked periodically for safety and comfort.\r\n9. After the patient is in restraints, the clinician begins treatment, using verbal intervention.\r\n10. 9. After the patient is under control, one   restraint at a time should be removed at 5-minute intervals until the patient has only two restraints on. Both of the remaining restraints should be removed at the same time.\r\n11. Always thoroughly document the reason for restraints, the course of treatment, and the patient’s response to treatment while in restraints.\r\nPharmacological approach to violent behavior-\r\nDos and Don’ts:\r\n Follow local protocols where available.\r\n Document all decisions and actions.\r\n Have a low threshold for obtaining senior advice.\r\n Always prescribe oral and I/M doses separately to avoid confusion.\r\n Do not mix medications in the same syringe.\r\n Do not use two different drugs of same class for rapid tranquillization.\r\n\r\nPotential risks of Pharmacological management-\r\n1. Over-sedation causing loss of consciousness and alertness.\r\n2. Cardiovascular or respiratory collapse.\r\n3. Interaction with prescribed or elicit medication.\r\n4. Damage to therapeutic relationship \r\n\r\nA guide to rapid tranquillization:\r\n First line –\r\n Non psychotic context – Oral Lorazepam (1–2mg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPsychotic context -- Oral Lorazepam 1–2mg and oral anti-psychotic \r\n                                     (Haloperidol 10-20 mg, chlorpromazine 50 – 100 mg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Second line- \r\n               (Oral medication failed or refused or not indicated)\r\n               \r\n                Non psychotic context- IM Lorazepam 1-2 mg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Psychotic context- \r\n IM Lorazepam 1-2 mg plus IM Haloperidol 10–20 mg  or \r\n IM Olanzapine  or\r\n IM Chlorpromazine 25 – 100 mg  or\r\n IM Depot zuclopenthixol acetate 50 – 150 mg \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Exceptional circumstances – Immediate tranquillization necessary –\r\n  IV Benzodiazepine (e.g. Diazepam 10 mg) \r\n  IV Haloperidol 2 – 10 mg\r\n\r\n\r\n Third line -\r\n  Other treatments (e.g. paraldehyde) or combinations of the above \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter care:\r\n Respiration, pulse, BP should be monitored within an hour of drug administration and regularly thereafter.\r\n Look for EPSs, particularly acute dystonia, possible NMS.\r\n Remember: Fatalities have occurred during emergency restraints. \r\nPredicting the human nature is not easy & predicting the nature of Bangladeshi people is even more difficult. And thus after taking all these steps, things still can go wrong and in that case we cannot but agree with, P Madhok who wrote-\r\n“There is something to be said for young doctors who should learn Martial arts. The world is increasingly progressing towards violence. So martial arts are worthwhile learning for self-defense. It will boost the doctor’s confidence even if not used.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences & further reading-\r\n1.

Introduction: \r\nLet me say a story of a “construction worker” who received a deep penetrating wound in his sole of the right foot with a dirty nail……………..\r\nWhat do you think about the disease of this gentleman? \r\nOur today’s topic is “Tetanus” \r\nPrerequisite knowledge on Clostridium tetani – causative organism of Tetanus. \r\n• General character- spore bearing, anerobic rods \r\n• Habitat\r\n• Culture character\r\n• Viability- spores remain viable almost indefinitely, killed by moist heat 121ᵒ C for 20 minutes, Penicillin \r\n• Toxins and enzymes- Tetanospasmins, very powerful neurotoxin \r\n• Antigenicity \r\nPathogenicity – causes Tetanus in human\r\nObjectives\r\n• To understand the disease process of Tetanus \r\n• To be able to examine and diagnose a case of Tetanus\r\n• To be able to treat a case of Tetanus \r\n• To learn the importance of prophylaxis for Tetanus\r\nKey Points \r\nClostridium tetani, spores, susceptible wounds, neurotoxins, latent tetanus, acetylcholine, neuromuscular junction, lock jaw, risus sardonicus, opisthotonus, human anti tetanus globulin, penicillin, metronidazole\r\n\r\nII. Tetanus:\r\nNeurotoxic disease caused by exotoxin of Cl. tetani at the site of infection in a susceptible wound in human \r\nPrevalence\r\nSusceptible wounds \r\nSource of organism\r\nIncubation period \r\nEvolution of the disease – Tetanospasmin inhibits cholinesterase at motor end plates, and excess of acetylcholine locally causes tonic muscle spasm, travels along nerves to CNS to cause explosive and wide spread reflex muscle spasm. \r\nPeriod of onset/incubation period\r\nLatent tetani\r\nSymptoms- dysphagia, jaw stiffness, severe pain in neck, back, abdomen etc. \r\nSigns – Tonic muscle spasm, sardonic smile, respiratory and swallowing difficulty, reflex convulsion- opisthotonus, respiratory failure and death\r\n\r\nDifferential Diagnosis\r\nTreatment –      Human anti tetanus globulin/tetanus anti toxin\r\n Tetanus toxoid \r\n Antibiotics – Penicillin and Metronidazole\r\n General measures- stage 1 (Mild cases), stage 2 (severely ill), stage 3 (dangerously ill)\r\n Care of the wound \r\nPrognosis \r\nProphylaxis – immunization\r\n Childhood \r\n Maternal \r\n After inflicting susceptible wound \r\n- Antibiotic \r\n- Care of the wound\r\nQuestions – why the organism is dangerous?\r\n- Why the disease is serious?\r\n- Tell about the effective preventive measures.\r\nDoes anybody have any question?\r\n\r\nIII. Conclusion: \r\nSummary- gm+ve anerobic spore bearing Cl. tetani causes tetanus through its powerful neurotoxin by blocking acetylcholine metabolism at motor end plate of skeletal muscles leading to local and generalized muscles spasm to death. Prophylaxis is effective and preferred. Treatment is difficult and expensive. Prognosis is gloomy. \r\nTake home message- ubiquity of Cl. tetani render tetanus eradication impossible, but it is vaccine preventable disease.

Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, and hearing voices that others do not, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.\r\n\r\nThe causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors. Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, certain infections, parental age and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior, the person\'s reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person. During diagnosis a person\'s culture must also be taken into account. Schizophrenia does not imply a \"split personality\" or \"dissociative identity disorder\" – conditions with which it is often confused in public perception.\r\n\r\nThe mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counseling, job training and social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In those who do not improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.\r\n\r\nAbout 0.3–0.7% of people are affected by schizophrenia during their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected, and on average experience more severe symptoms. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. About 50% have lifelong impairment. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This is the result of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.\r\nSchizophrenia has great human and economic costs. It results in a decreased life expectancy by 10–25 years. This is primarily because of its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.\r\n\r\nSchizophrenia is a major cause of disability, with active psychosis ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7 million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%.\r\n\r\nTeaching-learning methods:\r\na.

Introduction:\r\nWe get nutrients from outside through diet and the gastrointestinal tract is the portal through which these nutrients enter the body. Most of the nutrients present in food are in more complex  form which are not suitable to enter the body. In the digestive tract, these more complex macronutrients are broken down into suitable absorbable form. Conversion of complex macronutrients into suitable absorbable form is called digestion. Basic changes occur in digestion are softening, lubricating and hydrolysis of food particles and digestion occurs in different parts of alimentary tract. For this purpose, two basic requirements are digestive juices and movements of alimentary tract. \r\nMajor carbohydrates in ordinary diet are starch, cellulose (Dietary fibers), sucrose, lactose. Carbohydrate digestion starts in mouth. Starch is digested by salivary α amylase and pancreatic α amylase into maltose, maltotriose and α limit dextrin. In small intestine, these maltose, maltotriose and α limit dextrin are digested by maltase and α limit dextrinase into glucose. Sucrose and lactose are digested by sucrase and lactase in small intestine to produce glucose, fructose and galactose. Cellulose is not digested in our body. But it acts as dietary fibers.\r\n\r\nThese end products of digestion pass through the intestinal mucosa and enter into the circulation by the process, which is called absorption. Absorption of glucose, fructose, galactose occur in duodenum and upper jejunum by different types of transport systems. Glucose and galactose are transported from lumen to enterocyte by -Secondary active transport (Na glucose/ galactose co-transport). Then they are transported from enterocyte to circulation by- Facilitated diffusion. Fructose is absorbed by –Facilitated diffusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

Learning Objectives\r\nAfter completion of the session students will be able:\r\na) To define and classify burns\r\nb) To assess the area and depth of burns\r\nc) To understand the methods of calculating the quantity and rate of fluid to be infused\r\nd) To understand the technics for treating burned area and the patient \r\ne) To understand the pathophysiology of electrical and chemical burns\r\n\r\nII. Introduction \r\nThe incidents of burn injury varies greatly between cultures. In United Kingdom, 175,000 (of 65 million population), in United States 2 million (of 250 million) and in Australia-Newzeland 1% of population attend accident and emergency departments suffering from burns. About 50% of those suffer from daily living activity restriction, 10% require hospitalization and 10% of those hospitalized suffer with burns of sufficient severity to threaten life. Half of the victims are under 16 years of age. Some burns occur as genuine accidents but most are caused by carelessness, inattention, pre-existing medical conditions or follow alcohol or drug abuse. Most electrical and chemical injuries occur in adults. Cold and radiation injuries are very rare causes of burn. \r\nIn Bangladesh, the incidence of burn injury (though not accurate data) is approximately 3 million (of 120 million-in 2012) which is much higher than developed countries, largely due to poor electrical installations and open fire cooking, heating and smoking in households. \r\nLegislation, health promotion, appliance design regulation regarding flammable clothes and furniture, promotion of smoke alarm, education of parents etc. can reduce the incidence of burns.\r\nA large injury has a significant impact on patient, family, friends and patient’s future. Burned patients are managed initially like any other trauma patients (A, B, C, D……of ATLS). Estimation of area and depth of burn and estimation of fluid requirements is crucial in early management of burns. Multidisciplinary approach is needed for adequate and effective care of the burned patients. Better understanding of the control of physiology along with improvements in reconstruction and rehabilitation services will provide a better future for burned victims. \r\nIII. Teaching Learning Methods\r\na) Face-to-face interactive lecture on burn for third-year students in a lecture hall of Ibrahim Medical college.\r\nb) Tutorials for small groups on assessment of area of burn, methods of calculation of fluid requirement, exercise on first aid and emergency management of burned patients (ATLS) etc. \r\nc) Bed-side teaching on burn wound care, complications of burn like post-burn contracture, keloids, marjolin’s ulcer etc. \r\nd) Individualized learning; reading selective chapters from books, articles, journals, and websites. \r\nIV.

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (221, 186, 'Principle of effective teaching and learning', 'A)  Definition of Teaching & Learning\r\nTeaching-\r\n      Teaching is an interactive process as well as an intentional activity that provides opportunities for students to learn.\r\n       Teaching is interaction involving teacher, student and tasks. Purpose of teaching is to facilitate learning. \r\nLearning-\r\n     Learning is a constructive & active process that results in change in behavior and some modification in way of thinking, feeling & doing.\r\n       Learning is an experience that generates many things like- skills, insight, appreciation, attitudes and feeling toward self, others, learning and life itself.  \r\nB)  Strategies to enhance effective learning\r\nStrategies that research indicates can be very effective in helping struggling learners to successfully master new academic skills:\r\n• 1. Instructional Match. We have to ensure that students are being taught at the optimal instructional level, one that challenges them but provides enough success to keep these students confident and invested in learning.\r\n• 2. Scaffolding. We have to provide \'scaffolding\' support (individual instructional modifications) to students as necessary to help them to master a new task or keep up with more advanced learners. Examples of scaffolding strategies include reducing the number of problems assigned to a student, permitting the student to use technological aids (e.g., word processing software which predicts student word selection to reduce keyboarding), and using cooperative learning groups that pool the group\'s knowledge to complete assignments.\r\n• 3. Step-by-Step Strategies. For complex, conceptually difficult, or multi-step academic operations, we have to break these operations down into simple steps & teach students to use the steps. \r\n• 4. Modeling & Demonstration. We have to model and demonstrate explicit strategies to students for learning academic material or completing assignments. Have them use these strategies under supervision until we are sure that students understand and can correctly use them.\r\n• 5. Performance Feedback. Make sure that students who are mastering new academic skills have frequent opportunities to try these skills out with immediate corrective feedback and encouragement. Prompt guidance and feedback will prevent students from accidentally \'learning\' how to perform a skill incorrectly!\r\n• 6. Opportunities to Drill & Practice to Strengthen Fragile Skills. As students become more proficient in their new skills and can work independently, give them lots of opportunities to drill and practice to strengthen the skills. Whenever possible, make student practice sessions interesting by using game-like activities; coming up with real-world, applied assignments; or incorporating themes or topics that the student finds interesting.\r\n• 7. Student \'Talk-Through\' Activities. When students appear to have successfully learned a skill, set up activities for them to complete and ask the students to \'talk\' you through the activity (i.e., announce each step that they are taking, describe their problem-solving strategies aloud, describe any road-blocks that they run into and tell you how they will go about solving them, etc.).\r\n• 8. Periodic Review. Once students have mastered a particular academic skill, the instructor will quickly move them on to a more advanced learning objective. However, as teacher we should make sure that students retain previously mastered academic skills by periodically having them review that material. \r\n• 9. Progress Monitoring. Teachers can verify that students are making appropriate learning progress only when they are able to measure that progress on a regular basis. The instructor may want to consider information from several assessment approaches to monitor student progress: e.g., curriculum-based assessment, accuracy and completeness of student assignments, student \'talk-through\' demonstrations of problem-solving, etc.\r\nIn other words there are 6 principles of teaching characteristics that facilitate learning-\r\n1. Interest and explanation\r\n2. Concern and respect for students and student learning\r\n3. Appropriate assessment and feedback\r\n4. Clear goals and intellectual challenge\r\n5. Independence, control and active engagement\r\n6. Learning from students\r\n\r\nStrategies for learning from learner’s perspectives are-\r\n• Attending class. \r\n• Reading books. \r\n• Writing \r\n• Examining patient.\r\n• Discussion with peers\r\n\r\nC)   Conditions of Learning\r\n      An atmosphere or conditions to facilitate learning are learning environment which-\r\n• Encourages people to be Active\r\n• Emphasize the personal nature of  learning\r\n• Accept that difference is desirable.\r\n• Recognize the people’s right to make mistake.\r\n• Tolerates imperceptions.\r\n• Encourages openness of self & trust in self\r\n• Makes people feel respected & accepted.\r\n• Facilitates discovery.\r\n• Puts emphasis on self-evaluation & cooperation.\r\n• Permits confrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\nD)  Roles of a teacher\r\n         12 roles of the medical teacher, adapted from Harden, R.M & Crosby, J (2000)  \r\nFacilitator-\r\n                1.

Studying habits are skills that can be improved throughout a person\'s life by the application of effective learning techniques and strategies. \r\nThe different strategies are-\r\n• Attending classes\r\n• Reading books\r\n• Examining patients\r\n• Project works\r\n• Problem based learning\r\n• Independent group works\r\n• Discussion with peers\r\nTeachers need to integrate learning strategies into teaching which can help students to learn the skills, which include-\r\n• How to learn in a class, take notes, provide answers, use hand outs\r\n• How to work effectively in a group\r\n• How to engage in a discussion\r\n• How to find information\r\nBy these strategies, they can develop independent learning and personal skills.\r\n\r\nConditions of learning-\r\nLearning situation has two parts- one internal (capabilities that already exists in learner before new learning starts) to the learner and the other external (different stimulus exist outside the learner) to the person. The relationship between the two parts and the behavior change are called the conditions of learning.\r\nSo, the conditions of learning are-\r\n• Clearly defined objectives\r\n• Scope of active participation\r\n• Scope of frequent brief practice\r\n• Specific feedback to identify error\r\n• Reinforcing practice of correct elements\r\n• Study skill and learn how to learn\r\n• Fostering deep approaches\r\n\r\nRoles of a teacher-\r\nTeacher plays a very important role in teaching and learning that supports students to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. \r\nRoles of a teacher are-\r\n• Information provider- teachers identify and articulate clear learning objective and provide instruction through large group teaching like lectures, small group teaching like clinical and practical teaching or individual teaching.\r\n• Role model- teachers may be a role model to the students by their teaching qualities.\r\n• Facilitators- they act as mentor and facilitator by providing relevant and continuous feedback and supporting learner to be an independent learner.\r\n• Assessor- teachers assess prior learning by using a variety of assessment tools and evaluate assessment data and take required steps. They also evaluate curriculum.\r\n• Planner- they play important role in planning curriculum, selecting objectives and organizing course.\r\n• Resource provider- They also provide resource and study guide.\r\n\r\nTypes of clinical teaching-\r\nClinical teaching is teaching which takes place in a clinical context. It usually involves teachers, learners and patients and clinical procedures, and as such, necessitates sensitivity, confidentiality and discretion. \r\nThere are three types of clinical teaching-\r\n• Bed side teaching\r\n• Teaching in clinical skill center\r\n• Ambulatory care teaching\r\nBed side teaching-\r\nIt is a special type of small group teaching in presence of patient. A clinical teacher and a group of learners see a patient, listen to the history (from patient or learner), elicit or verify physical signs, discuss provisional diagnosis, diagnostic or therapeutic options. \r\nDuring this the teacher will observe learners’ patient interactions and their thinking skills. It is a rich visual, auditory, tactile & olfactory experience.\r\nTeaching in clinical skill center-\r\nThe clinical skills center was developed to teach and assess the clinical skills of medical students, residents and physicians in an environment that simulates the clinical settings. The center is used for both teaching and assessing clinical communication and physical exam skills, and it will be the site in which students take their multi-station Objective Structured Clinical Exams (OSCEs).  Faculty will also use the center to develop clinical teaching skills.\r\nAmbulatory care teaching-\r\nAmbulatory care refers to medical services performed on an outpatient basis, without admission to a hospital or other facility. Ambulatory care is provided in settings such as dialysis clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, hospital outpatient departments, and the offices of physicians and other health professionals.

Learning is a process resulting in some modification relatively permanent of the behavior, in the way of thinking, feeling and doing of the learner. Teaching is an organized communication and interactive process concerned with learning to nurture thinking ability.\r\n\r\nTeaching-In its generic form is concerned with providing student with opportunities to learn, or it may be defined as an organized communication between the teacher and the students\r\nPurpose of teaching- \r\n1. To facilitate learning \r\n2. Acquire and retain knowledge\r\n3. Use knowledge to understand, analyze, synthesis and evaluate\r\n4. Achieve skills\r\n5. Develop attitude\r\n\r\nLearning:\r\nLearning is a continuous process\r\nResulting in some modification in way of thinking, feeling and doing\r\nConstructive and active process that result in change in behavior\r\nTaking new information, build it on existing knowledge\r\nEstablishing connection within and between units of knowledge\r\n\r\nEffective learning: It becomes effective when the objectives are clearly understood by the students. In addition, correct practice and timely and appropriate feedback from the teachers makes learning more effective so, strategies for effective learning are\r\n1. Identify and articulate clear learning objective\r\n2. Provide instructions through large or small group teaching or individually\r\n3. Use instructional methods\r\n4. Engage all students actively\r\n5. Assess and monitor continuously\r\n6. Provide relevant and continuous feedback\r\n7. Support learner to be an independent learner\r\nCondition of learning:\r\nFollowing atmosphere is helpful for facilating learning- \r\n1. Encourage people to be active\r\n2. Emphasize the personal nature of learning\r\n3. Accept that difference is desirable\r\n4. Recognize the people’s right to make mistake\r\n5. Tolerates Imperceptions \r\n6. Encourages openness of self and trust in self\r\n7. Make people feel respected and accepted\r\n8. Facilitate discovery\r\n9. Puts emphasis on self-evaluation and cooperation\r\n10. Permits confrontation\r\n\r\nRole of a teacher:\r\nIn clinical teaching the teacher and the students come in contact with each other with a prior set of knowledge, experience and expectations. It is vital for the teacher to know the learners existing knowledge and identify the deficiency so, a good teacher should have 12 roles for an effective clinical teaching-\r\n1. Information provider during lecture\r\n2. Information provider in clinical/ practical teaching\r\n3. Role model in teaching\r\n4. Role model in job\r\n5. Teacher acts as learning facilator\r\n6. Act as a mentor\r\n7. Teachers are assessors for student\r\n8. Assessor for curriculum\r\n9. Teachers are planner for curriculum\r\n10. Planner for course\r\n11. Teachers are study guide producer\r\n12. Teachers are resource material creator\r\n     \r\n\r\nClinical teaching: Teaching learning involving patient and their problems\r\nThree types:\r\n1. Bed side teaching\r\n2. Teaching in clinical skill center\r\n3. Ambulatory care teaching\r\n\r\nEducational objectives:\r\n1. Clinical skill\r\n2. Communication skill\r\n3. Clinical reasoning\r\n4. Practical procedure like CV line, CPR, Venipuncture, catheterization\r\n5. Patient investigation and management\r\n6. Data interpretation and retrieval\r\n7. Professional skill- role model for professional behavior\r\n8. Attitude and ethics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-03-30 08:18:23', 'upload/attachment/57391b621454ff12820c57ac650f778f.docx', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Spacing – spaced practice/ spiraling – review\r\n2. Retrieval practice\r\n3. Elaboration – with open ended questions by self/ facilitator\r\n4. Interleaving – a skill is learned more effectively if mix practice of it with other skills\r\n5. Concrete examples\r\n6. Dual coding – text with visuals (image, chart, graph, graphic organizer, diagram, sketch etc.)\r\n\r\nConditions of Learning\r\nDifferent internal and external conditions are necessary for each type of learning. For example –\r\nFor cognitive strategies – a chance to practice developing new solutions of problems.\r\nFor attitude – exposed to a credible role model or persuasive arguments \r\nFor intellectual skill - stimulus recognition/ classical conditioning \r\nresponse generation in operant conditioning \r\nchaining/ procedure following – complex operant conditioning\r\nverbal association – use of terminology\r\ndiscrimination – learning of responding different to different stimuli\r\nconcept formation – learning a general response to a class of stimuli\r\nrule application – a rule is a chain of two or more concepts \r\nproblem solving – application of previously learned rules and concepts to new situation\r\nConditions of learning (R.Gagne) outlines 9 instructional events and corresponding cognitive processes: mental conditions for learning\r\n1. Gain attention – stimuli activates receptors\r\n2. Inform learners of objectives – creates level of expectation for learning \r\n3. Stimulate recall prior learning – retrieval on activation of short term memory\r\n4. Present the content – selective perception of content\r\n5. Provide “learning guidance” – semantic encoding for storage long term memory\r\n6. Elicit performance (practice) – response to questions to enhance encoding and verification\r\n7. Provide feedback – reinforcement and assessment of correct performance\r\n8. Asses performance – retrieval and reinforcement of content as final evaluation\r\n9. Enhance retention and transfer to the job – retrieval and generalization of learned skill to new situation\r\nConditions to facilitate learning – an atmosphere which \r\n encourages people to be active\r\n emphasize the personal nature of learning\r\n accept that difference is desirable\r\n recognize the people’s right to mistake\r\n tolerates interceptions\r\n encourage openness of self and trust in self\r\n makes people feel respected and accepted\r\n facilitates discovery\r\n puts emphasis on self-evaluation and cooperation\r\n permits confrontation\r\n\r\n\r\nRoles of a teacher\r\nThere are six areas of activity of the teacher. Each of the six areas can be subdivided into two roles, making a total of twelve roles. Some roles are associated with face to face contact with students while others are associated with less student contact. Some roles require more content expertise and some require more educational expertise. The twelve educational roles are:\r\n Information provider – \r\n1. Lecturer in classroom setting \r\n2. Teacher in clinical or practical class setting\r\nRole model – \r\n3. On-the-job role model (eg. in clinics, ward rounds etc.)\r\n4. Role model in the teaching setting\r\nFacilitator – \r\n5. Mentor, personal advisor or tutor to a student or group of students\r\n6. Learning facilitator (eg. Supporting students’ learning in a problem based learning small group in the laboratory, in the integrated practical class session or in the clinical setting) \r\nExaminer – \r\n7. Planning or participating in formal examinations of students\r\n8. Curriculum evaluator – evaluation of the teaching program and the teachers\r\nPlanner – \r\n9. Curriculum planner, participating in overall planning of the curriculum, through for example, curriculum planning committees such as Undergraduate Medical Education Committee\r\n10.  Course organizer, responsibility for planning and implementing a specific course within the curriculum. This may for example relate to one system or one theme or to a special study module\r\nResource developer – \r\n11.  Production of study guide to support the students’ learning in the course\r\n12.  Developing learning resource materials in the form of computer programs, video tapes or print which can be used as adjuncts to the lecture or other sessions  \r\nOther roles for the teacher include \r\n• Clinical\r\n• Administrative\r\n• Research\r\n• Develop a positive, respectful working relationship\r\n• Provide the teacher assistants with the requisite information \r\n• Reports to parents\r\na. Informal, ongoing\r\nb. Formal, written reports\r\n• Maintain records\r\n• Developing supportive environment for learners\r\nEach teacher need not have all the roles. Some teachers will have only one role while most teachers will have several roles. All roles, however, need to be represented in an institute or teaching organization.\r\n\r\nTypes of Clinical Teaching\r\nTeaching learning involving patients and their problems. \r\n• Bedside teaching\r\n• Teaching in clinical skill center\r\n• Ambulatory care teaching\r\n• Case method \r\n• Process recording\r\n• Individual conference\r\n• Group conference\r\n• Teaching rounds\r\n• Assignments\r\n• Role play\r\n• Field trip\r\n• Teaching in protected time\r\n• Teaching in out-patients\r\n• Teaching in general practice \r\n• Teaching on call in A&E\r\n• Teaching in the theatre room\r\n\r\nEducational objectives that can be achieved in the bedside teaching\r\n• Clinical skills: \r\nFor junior students – opportunities to become proficient at normal physical examinations\r\nFor more senior students – opportunities in eliciting abnormal physical signs\r\n• Communication skills\r\n• Clinical reasoning: students can observe this in practice by junior and senior staff\r\n• Practical procedures: \r\n1. Venipuncture\r\n2. Bladder catheterization\r\n3. Cannulation of a peripheral vein\r\n4. Central venous line\r\n5. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation\r\n• Patient investigation and management: opportunities for students to observe and discuss aspects of both of these\r\n• Data interpretation and retrieval: interpretation of laboratory reports and assessing scientific papers for reference \r\n• Professional skills\r\no Observation of both junior and senior doctors in their working relationship with other healthcare professionals help students develop role models for professional behavior\r\n• Transferable skills \r\n• Attitude and ethics: Attitude and ethics towards patients and attending healthcare workers \r\n• Develop familiarity with healthcare services and facilities\r\n• Accumulate factual healthcare knowledge \r\n• Acquire positive attitude to independent learning  \r\nAll these aspects can be seen in the context of the patient as an individual. Students should be encouraged to return to the ward in private study time to practice clinical skills further.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n \r\n', '2018-03-31 12:58:40', 'upload/attachment/4881b78b2e089c44a9f0e0bc96e2917f.docx', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

How will you run the workshop( Write Schedule) c. Write your plan of post workshop evaluation meeting. ', 'Module: 3 Teaching-learning\r\nAssignment of M3 U2 \r\nFellow ID: 181020\r\nWorkshop is a common educational format for transmitting information and promoting skill acquisition. Workshops are teaching and learning arrangements, usually in small groups, that are structured to produce active participation in learning. Traditionally, workshops provided participants with some opportunity to practice skills and receive feedback.\r\na) Pre-workshop plan-\r\n1) Selection of topic and the learning objectives of the workshop will be specified-\r\nEvery decisions that are taken about the workshop will depend on objectives for the learner and the success will be measured against its objectives. It is also useful to specify the performance levels and the conditions for each learning objective. A day long workshop may provide opportunity for participants to share ideas, experiences, and understanding on a topic if objectives are clearly specified.\r\n2) We have to find out who will be the participants of the workshop-  \r\nWe have to determine who the participants will be. What is their knowledge of the topic? What is their previous experience with this subject matter? What are their needs and expectations? By informing all these along with our topic and objectives, we can send e-mail to different medical colleges for registration. \r\n3) Selection of venue-\r\nVenue will be convenient and comfortable for all- participants and speakers. It should be spacious with appropriate light, power supply, generator facilities, free internet facilities, sound proofed along with other necessary facilities.\r\n4) Seating arrangement\r\nCircular seating arrangements foster sharing of power and interaction between members. Long tables with the teacher at one end tend to concentrate control in the teacher and reduce the tendency for interaction among participants. \r\n\r\n\r\n5)  Selection and management of time schedule of resource persons and speakers-\r\nSelection of qualified resource persons, speakers and anchor will be done according to the topic and availability of their time schedules.\r\n6) Fixation of date of workshop-\r\nDate of workshop is fixed according to the availability of venue and schedule of resource persons.\r\n7) Well organized Program schedule, Materials and Handouts-\r\nThey should be well organized, carefully written and targeted for the participants. These can be kept in a file along with pen drive, pen and writing pad 1 hour before the workshop on the seating place of the participants.\r\n8)  Determination of teaching method and design the appropriate workshop activities-\r\nOnce the objectives of the teaching session are clarified, then we have to choose the teaching method that will best meet our overall goals. A number of methods can be used to involve a group in active learning. These include lectures, small group teaching, case discussions, role plays and simulations, and opportunities for practising specific skills. Workshops should encourage problem-solving and/or skill acquisition.\r\n9) Instructional materials should be checked-\r\nLaptops and related materials for power point presentation should be checked. Fumbling with equipment wastes time. It should be ensured that there are white board markers, pens for flip chart writing and tape if we want to hang some sheets.\r\n10) Preparation of Pre workshop, Post work shop evaluation questionnaire and Feedback form on workshop-\r\nThese should be done very carefully.\r\n11) Timing-\r\nIt is important but difficult to keep schedule in track of time. Appointing a timekeeper can be considered. Ten to twenty percent more time can be added for each activities. Real activities usually take longer time than the planned ones.\r\n12) Budget-  Amount and source of budget should be fixed.\r\nb) Schedule of workshop on\r\nMedical Education\r\nDate -\r\nVenue\r\n\r\n\r\nSerial No. Time Topic Resource person\r\n1 8.00 AM - 9.00 AM Inauguration ceremony and Ice breaking \r\n2 9.00 AM - 9:30 AM Pre test \r\n     3 9.30 AM - 10:15 AM Educational objectives and domain of learning Name of resource person\r\n    4 10.15 AM - 10:45 AM Tea break \r\n    5 10.45 AM - 11:30 AM Preparing Power Point presentation Name of the resource person\r\n    6 11.30 AM – 12.15 PM Interactive large group teaching Name of the resource person\r\n    7 12.15 PM – 1.00 PM Small group teaching  Name of the resource person\r\n    8 1.00 PM – 1.45 PM Prayer and lunch \r\n    9 1.45 PM – 2.30 PM Group work (5 groups, 4 participants in each group)  By all participants\r\n   10 2.30 PM – 3.30 PM Presentation and feed back on group work \r\n   11 3.30 PM – 4.00 PM Post test evaluation and participant’s feedback on workshop by questionnaire \r\n   12 4.00 PM - 4.15 PM Tea break \r\n   13 4.15 PM- 4.45 PM Certificate distribution, closing session and thanks giving \r\n   14 4.45 PM – 5.00 PM Photo session \r\n\r\n\r\nC) Plan of post workshop evaluation meeting-\r\nJust like planning the workshop design, the evaluation of the workshop focuses on the goals for the workshop and how effectively the goals for the workshop are met. Post workshop evaluation meeting will be held by the organizers and conveners as early as possible after the ending of work shop. \r\nIn the workshop evaluation meeting- We have to do the following things-\r\n• Development of a post-workshop evaluation summary that includes the weak points and success of workshop, information from the feedback form on workshop \r\n• Collection of participant’s action plan after the workshop \r\n• Collection of convener’s observations.\r\n• Planning of a post-workshop follow up survey of participants that focuses on action plan responses.\r\n• Finally, bringing participants back together for a second workshop can enhance impact \r\nAttendance and satisfaction of the participants are usually accepted as evidence by administrators and workshop planners of the successfulness of a workshop. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-04-06 10:08:35', 'upload/attachment/6ba272cd217a8e6092ca8009ed0de6ef.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Objective of the course need to be communicated to students as well as tutor\r\nInstructional method- Prepare contents of  teaching manual, which is composed of a core patient (summary of patients with a major disease), learning objective, case scenario, questions for  group discussion , teaching guide and references for all discipline\r\nSelect a coordinator- Form a core group from representative department and discuss individual responsibility and other relevant issue, as negotiation among disciplines is very essential\r\nPrepare a conceptual framework for planning and implementing integration and communicate with students and teaching staff\r\nManpower- Large member of teaching staff/ tutor familiar with facilitating workshop is required. Tutor need to acquire some basic expertise on teaching. Appropriate staff development programs should be available to meet the needs of the tutor\r\nPhysical:\r\nRoom- A suitable room of appropriate size is required which should be noise free and comfortable with adequate space\r\nArrangement- Requires suitable accommodation and allows chair to be set out in such a way that face to face interaction possible.\r\nMaterial- flipchart, overhead projector, patient, model, books study guide as learning material\r\n\r\nFollowing steps to be followed for smooth running of workshop:\r\n\r\nLesson plan-\r\nForming: Allow adequate introduction that relaxes and introduces the member of the group. Tension is also reduced among group.\r\nNorming: Establish ground rules to attain proper educational climate, setting of behavior and respect to other are essential. Contribution should also be received positively\r\nBriefing: To ensure that the student understand the task and procedure.\r\nFacilitate the learning to achieve the task: Tutor should facilate the learning and help the student become more self-reliant and independent. Tutor also helps students understanding of principles and concept and finally summarizes the discussion\r\nDebriefing the group on the activity: During debriefing constructive feedback may be given focusing on the good points fast; teacher also leads a discussion and provide the class member to demonstrate what they have learned. Learner must state the concepts learned in a clear and concise manner and integrate them appropriately with related knowledge and finally references for further reading\r\n\r\nEvaluate the success of session:\r\nEvaluation is an integral part of workshop. As with any other teaching method it is important to evaluate the success of session. There are two aspects of evaluation- achievement and quality. Informal evaluation can be done for each and every session by asking question to the students as well as by allowing them to ask questions. The formative assessment can be done at the end of the course\r\nRegular evaluation is essential to improve the quality or effectiveness of such program, which is usually measured by outcome such as paticipitants general reaction about the program or the knowledge gained from it\r\nContents of evaluation\r\n Communication skills\r\n Organization skills \r\n Enthusiasm \r\n Flexibility\r\n Attitude towards workshop\r\n Participant’s interaction\r\n Encouragement of the participant\r\n Knowledge of the subject Clarity of presentation\r\n Course difficulty\r\n Fairness of grading and examination\r\n\r\nEvaluation instruments: At the end of workshop, participants  are requested to complete a survey to evaluate the information received, the clarity of the workshop goals, the quality of presentation, instruction and workshop activity and then overall impressions on the events. Based on this feedback, the workshop is a success when the activities averaged greater than 4 on a scale of 1 to 5\r\n\r\n\r\nAction plan: \r\nThere should be an action plan activity at the close of the workshop. Evaluation formal or informal is pointless if no change in practice results .Competent evaluation will always identify the areas for improvement. Reflection cannot be effective in isolation. It should be on going and an integral part of any teaching practice.\r\n\r\nSample of workshop evaluation format (Your valuable comment will make us improve.

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (255, 206, 'Workshop on teaching \"Breaking Bad News\" skills  ', 'Workshop is a set of activities designed to promote learning, discussion, and feedback about a topic. It is a brief, intensive course for a small group which emphasizes problem-solving.\r\nPeople Attend Workshops because-\r\n•They provide a high-yield, interactive educational experience on an area of interest.\r\n•Topics are typically applicable to attendee’s professional development or clinical, educational, or research area of interest.\r\n•Their learning format is more efficient, effective, and enjoyable than a large-group lecture or self-directed reading on given subject.\r\n•Allow for networking with colleagues.\r\n\r\nWorkshops serve as an important component to an academician’s teaching portfolio. They provide opportunity to hone teaching skills, establish a national reputation, and find collaborators for other scholarly activities. Once completed, workshops can be used as a springboard for additional scholarly activity.\r\n\r\nA day long workshop on Medical Education for 20 participants-\r\nA)  Pre workshop plan-\r\nStep 1: Choosing a good Topic, Collaborators, and Venue\r\n•Almost any clinical, educational, or research topic can be adapted to a workshop format.\r\n•Presenters should be passionate about topic.\r\n•Topic is timely or potentially controversial.\r\n•Topic aligns with meeting’s educational objectives.\r\n•Workshop provides opportunity for “hands-on” or skill-based practice or learning.\r\n•Must be narrow enough to be covered in appropriate depth within time allotted, often 90 minutes.  \r\n‘Teaching Breaking Bad News Skills’ can be a topic of interest after the aircraft accident in Nepal. Participants may be teachers of Psychiatry faculty from different medical colleges. Venue can be conference hall of IMC.\r\nStep 2: Preparing the Workshop Submission: Structure, Abstract, and defining objectives for the teaching session. Finding out about the audience\r\nStep 3: Planning and Developing the Workshop Presentation. Determine our teaching method and design the appropriate workshop activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB) Schedule for the workshop\r\n\r\n\r\nFlexibility is one of the key ingredients of a successful workshop. As important as it is to plan ahead, it is even more important to be prepared to abandon prepared agenda. We have to-\r\n\r\nIntroduce the group members to the presenters and to each other\r\nOnce the workshop is underway, it is essential to determine who our audience is. It is better to go around the room and ask the group members to briefly introduce themselves and to state their expectations of the session. Finding out who is in our audience will help us strike the appropriate balance and meet the group’s needs and expectations.\r\nOutline the objectives for teaching session\r\nWe have to tell the group what we hope to accomplish in the available time and specify what we will & will not do. Try to match our objectives to the participants’ needs. Feedback on the proposed agenda is helpful in ensuring consensus between our suggested plan and the group’s needs.\r\nCreate a relaxed atmosphere for learning\r\nThe introduction of group members, outlining the workshop objectives and effective questioning & active participation by group members facilitates an atmosphere conducive to teaching and learning.\r\nEncourage active participation and allow for problem solving and/or skill acquisition\r\nParticipation is one key ingredients of a workshop so involving the group in all phases of the session is important. Invite questions, group discussion, and debate. Encourage the participants to learn from each other. If a problem is presented to the group, allow for group solutions.\r\nWhenever possible, limit group size so that active participation will be feasible. Physical arrangements can also facilitate interaction. For example, arrange the chairs so that the participants can all see each other. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nFigure 1.  Room layout for an interactive workshop. We can make 4 such arrangements for total 20 participants.\r\n\r\nIn particular, group members could be asked to work through a set of problems or to practice a specific skill. For example, in this workshop on ‘Teaching Breaking Bad News Skills’ we might ask smaller groups of individuals to discuss how they would teach a proper way of breaking bad news to a group of medical students or residents. We might also ask them where this teaching fits into the curriculum and how this skill might best be taught. On the other hand, we might ask the group members to demonstrate the skill on a ‘dummy’ and receive feedback from the group.\r\nProvide relevant and practical information\r\nAlthough active participation and interaction are essential to a successful workshop, the participants must also feel that they have learned something. Workshops are meant to promote the acquisition of new knowledge as well as aptitudes and skills. Some information must, therefore, be provided. Mini-lectures are definitely permissible in a workshop. They often help to set the tone, to cover the basic data, and to ensure a common ground for discussion. Two hours of lecturing in a two hour workshop is, however, not acceptable. Participants should have an opportunity to respond to the presented information. Questions and comments from group participants should also be encouraged.\r\nRemember principles of adult learning\r\nAdults come to learning situations with a variety of motivations and expectations about teaching goals and methods. Moreover, as much of adult learning involves ‘relearning’ rather than new learning, adults often resent the ‘student’ role. Incentives for adult learning usually come from within the person, and feedback is more important than are tests and evaluation. (Knowles, 1978) It is important, therefore, to respect the group’s previous knowledge and experience, their motivation to learn, their potential resistance to change, and their ability to serve as co-learners.\r\nVary your activities and your style\r\nMake sure that the workshop flows at a pace that keeps the participants’ attention. Appropriate pacing implies moving the workshop along while leaving room for the group to slow down or speed up the presentation. \r\nSummarization of the session and request feedback from the group\r\nRestate what we have tried to achieve in the workshop, synthesize the main points made, and discuss plans for follow-up, if appropriate. At times, it is helpful to ask group members to summarize what they have learned during the session. In addition, request feedback from the group as to whether we have accomplished our stated objectives and how to improve the session in the future.\r\nEnjoy ourselves and have fun\r\nIt is important to enjoy what we are doing. If we are enjoying ourselves and are not personally bored with what we are doing chances are that our participants will have a good time and learn something in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nC) Post workshop evaluation meeting\r\nEvaluation is an integral part of small group teaching. There are two aspects of evaluation- achievement and quality. Informal evaluation can be done for each and every session by asking question to the students as well as by allowing them to ask questions. The formative assessment can be done at the end of the workshop. In addition we can ask participants to complete an evaluation questionnaire consisting of closed and open ended questions. Competent evaluation will always identify the areas for improvement. Reflection should be ongoing and an integral part of any teaching practice including workshop sessions. \r\n\r\nReferences-\r\n1.

INSERT INTO `assignments_reply` VALUES (259, 226, 'Interactive large group teaching', 'Answer to question no. 1\r\ni) Lecture is one of the most common forms of instruction in medical education. Lectures can be boring and, worse, useless if they are merely recitation of standard text. There are some approaches to lecturing that makes it more refreshing and useful for students. A lecture is organized in three sections- Introduction, Body and Conclusion. The first 5-10 minutes of the lecture is spent on introduction. Lecturer must attract attention, establish rapport, Identify prior knowledge, provide advance organizer (objectives & key points) & indicate usefulness during introduction. So starting with the definition of burn was not an appropriate approach. Gaining attention of the students should have been the first step to start the lecture.\r\nii) If I am asked to conduct the class on the topic “Burn”, I would have prepared a skeletal hand out of the lecture and provide it to students at the beginning of the class. I would have prepared a power point presentation which starts with a picture of a burn victim of recent days and his/her sufferings in few words and with emotional touch. Then I would have stated the importance of treatment of a burn case that is the usefulness of the lecture, with the objectives of this class. Then I would have identified prior knowledge regarding skin, inflammations and some other related topic. By that time I would have established rapport with my students. This is roughly my plan to begin a class.\r\niii) The Professor could have gained their attention by giving them a short assessment like MCQ, or a short question to answer after discussion with nearby student from their prior knowledge. He could have asked them to mention a recent incidence causing burn injury of many people. He could even show a video clip with instruction on what to look for, to the back benchers. He could have just taken a pause showing a black slide that would have gained their attention. \r\niv) Thought and feeling are inseparable brain processes. This means that information associated with values and feelings will be more readily learned. So even in science disciplines students should be encouraged to develop passionate stances so that they will retain information more efficiently. As burning Rohingya village in Myanmar is a recent and emotionally touchy topic, it was justified to show in slide. Next slide could be on the changes of skin or other damages after burn, which will let them, know the importance & gain their interest of treatment of burn cases properly. So, I would have shown the burning village, followed by a picture of burn victim and telling the story of his/her sufferings in few words. It will make them more attentive for the lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer to question no. 2\r\n\r\nLarge group teaching describes the range of methods used to teach large groups usually over 30 or 40 students. The opponents of the large lecture sections argue that large lecture sections dilute the learning process, place an undue burden on faculty in terms of test monitoring, grading, office hours/student interaction, and course management. There is no agreed definition of a large class in the literature, nor should there be. Class size is perceived differently dependent upon the person teaching the course. A large class is one that feels large. Signs that the class is large‘ can be: the class is significantly larger than we are used to and the resources can no longer cope with the number of students if we desire individual attention for the students. Large classes are as effective as small classes when the goals involve learning factual information and comprehending that information. \r\nThe design of an interactive lecture is based on two simple guidelines:\r\n• Break the lecture into segments\r\n• Build-in opportunities for students to actively participate.\r\nHowever ‘Interactive lecture’ can be implemented in a class of 150 students by the team approach to collaborative learning. \r\nTeam structure: In organizing groups, teachers typically do four things:\r\n• They divide a large group, the class into small groups\r\n• They provide a task, usually designed (and, preferably, tested) ahead of time, for the small groups to work on\r\n• They reconvene the larger group into plenary sessions to hear reports from the small groups and negotiate agreement among the group as a whole.\r\n• They evaluate the quality of student work, first as referee, then as judge.\r\n             (Brufee, 1993)\r\n\r\nMcKeachie (1986) uses a buzz group technique to insure student participation in large classes. Dill (1977) describes a technique called ke ts‘ao, or ferment, used in China to get large groups to come to a concensus decision. Think-pair-share first proposed by Lyman in 1981 is another quick and easy method of engaging students in a collaborative activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne minute question/Minute paper/One-minute essay-\r\nOne-minute write activities ask students to stop what they are doing a produce a written response in only one minute. This technique can be used to collect feedback on understanding by asking them to identify what they thought the most confusing point was or to voice a question. It can also allow students an opportunity for immediate application. \r\nWe can ask each student write a very brief paper in which they 1) identify the key points, or 2) summarize the lecture. This activity is effective at the end of a lecture because it gives students a chance to solidify the information while the major points of the lecture are still fresh in their minds. It is also a way of interaction between teacher and student during the class. \r\nWhile concluding the lecture we can review the major points, propose unanswered questions, and create anticipation of the future. We can have them spend two to three minutes at the end of the period writing a summary of main points (the minute paper). As for example we can ask the students to write 3 main points to consider while writing antipsychotic for a particular given patient. We can then discuss one or two of the answers which will make a good interection.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer to question no. 3\r\n\r\nWe can start a lecture with a rhetorical question which is a question where no answer is expected. This type of questions can be used to grab the student’s attention.\r\n For example we might start a lecture on treatment-resistant schizophrenia by asking, “How many of you have dealt chronic schizophrenic patient and felt almost hopeless about their prognosis as the patient?” Let us learn something new about Resistant Schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nPerceived dangers cause the brain to downshift to its most rudimentary processing mode and bring learning to a halt.” Negative emotions such as stress or fear impede the brain’s ability to retain or retrieve information. In the classroom, this effect can be seen in overwhelming test anxiety, panic attacks during presentations, or classroom incivility. So, interaction will be hampered if we create a threatening environment if we ask direct recall questions on previous knowledge just at the beginning of the class without any ice breaking or proper introduction.\r\n“You from the 3rd row, tell me the pathological process of developing cerebral edema.” \r\n\r\nReferences-\r\n1.

The students near the back of th', '1)\r\ni)       There was no wrong in showing the definition of burn in power point slide. But, actually there was wrong in starting of class with showing the definition by using the power point slide. As we know, according to Gagne’s nine events of instruction, the 1st step of starting a class will be, gain attention of the students by asking some questions or by telling stories or showing some pictures or other ice breaking activities that provoke their thoughts and they feel interested and curious about the topic. Gaining attention also make the students to focus their attention to the content. But without doing these, he started his class by showing definition of burn in a power point slide, that made the students uninterested and distracted about the topic also made them absent minded in the class. \r\nHe also did not inform the students about the objectives of the session and did not recall their prior knowledge about burn. He could show the slide of definition during presenting the new content, in the body of the lecture after gaining attention and recalling the prior knowledge of the students. \r\nii)       If I am asked to run the class, at first, I shall try to gain attention of the students by showing a picture of crushed and burned flight or a picture of a building with fire and ask them,\r\n• What you are observing in this picture?\r\n• What will be the probable injuries?\r\n Then I shall inform them about the goals and objectives of the session. Because the students must know what they are going to learn, what they will be able to do at the end of the session, and how they will be able to use the knowledge or skills in the future. \r\nAfter that, I shall try to stimulate recall of prior learning by asking questions like, “what is burn? (not the definition, just to check concept) How it may occur?” and try to relate their prior knowledge with the topic.\r\niii)  .    The professor could have dealt with the situation at the back of the class by showing a picture of crashed aero plane with fire and by asking them about the recent incidence of plane crash and probable injuries of the passengers or to gain their attention instead of using a blank slide and asked the class to volunteer in defining ‘burn’.\r\niv)      Showing the burning village was not ok from my point of view. Showing a picture of burning Rohingya village in Myanmar may divert the students from the topic. There are students of different religions and different background in the class. It may arise racism and political conflict. Some students may feel down and may distract from the topic. This type of photograph may hurt anyone’s religious and political belief.\r\nFollowing things, I shall consider before using a photograph in such a class-\r\n• Is it necessary for the class or not\r\n• It’s advantages and dis advantages\r\n• It should be topic oriented\r\n• It should fulfil my expectations\r\n• It should compel the students to think about it and co relate with the topic\r\n• It should not divert the students from the topic\r\n• It should not arise any political and racial conflict \r\n• It should not violate anyone’s privacy\r\n• It should not criticize any company or organization\r\n• It should not beyond the ethics\r\n\r\n2) Yes, an interactive lecture can be implemented in a class of 150 students.\r\nOne-minute question-\r\nA “one-minute question” may be defined as a very short, in-class writing activity (taking one-minute or less to complete) in response to an instructor-posed question, which prompts students to reflect on the day’s lesson and provides the instructor with useful feedback.\r\n It is commonly used at the end of class to diagnose students’ understanding of key concepts or topics, but can also be used at any point at the middle of lecture.  \r\nOne Minute question can be utilized as an interaction technique in a lecture class in following way-\r\nOne Minute question paper is provided at the middle of lecture at a given point or at the end of the class with the following questions- \r\n • What are the (2-3) most significant things they have learned during the session?\r\n • What is the most confusing concept that has covered in today’s class? \r\nTypically, the One Minute question will ask the students to identify what they found most useful and what they found most challenging to help identify, if further support is needed.\r\nIn this way, we can involve all students in class simultaneously. It ensures equal participation of each and every class member, including anyone who may be too shy or fearful to participate orally. One minute paper can be used to stimulate and facilitate discussion of diversity. It can promote class attendance and attentiveness.\r\nStudent receive full credit for the one minute paper, no matter what they write, because the question does not ask for correct or incorrect answers, instead, it solicits their personal perceptions and experiences.\r\n\r\n3) \r\nOne dialogue that would be helpful in initiating interaction-\r\n  “Good morning! Hope you are well. You are young and energetic. I am watching lots of hope and spirit in your eyes. Mistakes will happen, but mistakes are proof that you are trying. Let’s learn together and do the best we can.”\r\n           \r\n            One dialogue that would hamper interaction-\r\n“Nothing can be happened with you. What is the benefit to teach you?

He started with the definition of ‘burn’ using a PowerPoint slide. The students near the back of the class seemed uninterested in the topic and were gossiping. The professor tried to attract their attention, but it created uproar in the class itself. To calm the class, he used a blank slide and asked the class to volunteer in defining ‘burn’. It brought a complete silence. Perplexed, he went to his next slide that showed a burning Rohingya village in Myanmar.\r\n \r\nAnswer the following questions considering the above scenario: 4+4+4+ (2+4) =18 \r\ni) Was there anything wrong with showing the definition of the slide? Explain. \r\nBeginning of any teaching-learning session should be with gaining attention of the students/participants and for gaining attention, teacher may ask a question, give a clinical scenario, show a photograph etc. Then, objectives of the session should be stated clearly; so that students can prepare their mind-set. Starting a lecture (large group teaching) by saying “definition of burn” (given scenario) was not a good start, rather it could be better if the lecture would start with a case scenario or story or a question such as, “Did any of you see a burn case?”\r\n\r\nii) If you are asked to run the class, how would you plan to begin? \r\nA lecture on “burn” may be started with a case scenario: A 28-year-old lady was brought to hospital emergency because of scalding pain of feet following accidental fall of boiling water from her hands at kitchen 1-hour ago. Skin of affected areas of feet is red, slightly swollen and very painful to touch. What is the diagnosis?\r\nAnother case scenario may be on burn on “garment factories burn” or “acid violence” may be given. Then the objectives of the session will be presented (definition, types, percentage of burn, complications, treatment etc.) and activation of prior knowledge will be made by asking regarding layers of skin, what is the average surface area of human body etc.\r\n\r\niii) How could the professor have dealt with the situation at the back of the class? \r\nThe professor could gently walk towards the back of the class while talking and express in such a way that it is difficult to listen and see the slides of PowerPoint from the back and encourage students of last one or two rows to come forward. On other wards, he could state that after the first 1 or two slides, there remains a “Quiz” for the students or could say that “burn” is very common and important topic for both “examination” and “clinical practice” or state a story on “burn”.\r\n\r\niv) Was showing the burning village OK? Justify your comment, and outline how you would like to use a photograph in such a class. \r\nI would go against showing such a photograph here. In a lecture for undergraduate class on “burn” one should not use such a photograph, which may have multiple dimensions; political, regional, racial etc. If photographs are to be used in such lectures, burn cases (with prior permission of patients/guardians, if minor) with limited burn of limbs (not face) should be used. Photographs will draw attention because of visual impression, and definitely audio-visual media is better that only lecture (audio).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Can an ‘interactive lecture’ be implemented in a class of 150 students? What is a ‘one-minute question’? Explain with an example how such a question can be utilized as an interaction technique in a lecture class. 2+5+7=14 \r\nInteractive lecture might be implemented in a class for 150 patients if adequate logistic supports are available. Minute paper/mini-minute essays are instructions for students to identify key points or summarization of lectures, usually done towards the end of a lecture. This helps students to solidify information while major points are still fresh in their minds.\r\nIf at the beginning of a class [like acute kidney injury (AKI)], lecturer conveys the message that there will be one minute questions after each segments like criteria for diagnosing AKI (definition), epidemiology, aetiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, management principles and outcome. There will be 6 different groups (from the whole class) and by lottery one group will be presenting one component (definition, clinical feature, lab. investigation, management principle etc.) and the other groups will be supplementing; thus the whole class is expected to remain attentive and a successful ‘interactive lecture’ is expected at the end.\r\n\r\n3. Create one dialogue that would be helpful in initiating interaction and one that would hamper interaction (in Bangla or in English). 4+4=8\r\nIn a lecture on chikungunya, interaction may be started by asking “how many of you have suffered from chikungunya in 2017 Dhaka outbreak?” Would you please raise your hands? On the other hand if it is asked that “how will you treat a case of chikungunya myocarditis?” \r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-04-14 09:10:01', 'upload/attachment/b8a517d996bb37bfeceda21e245cf0bd.docx', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

The probabilities are: \r\n• Visually poor slide- Type and color of fonts may be inappropriate (too small font size, use of all capitals, sarif font, red text on blue background or vice versa).\r\n• Room environment may lead to poor readability of the slide (light text in well lit room as house lights failed to deem or window blackouts were inadequate for projection to be seen; dark room with dark text).\r\n• Too much text on the slide (due to excessive details).\r\n• Template with distracting items \r\nAs the professors tried to attract their attention, it created uproar in the class itself so there may have other possibilities as well:\r\n• Topic of the day was not appropriate according to the schedule given to the students beforehand.\r\n• Worse still, the professor may have entered into the wrong class.\r\n\r\nII. If I were asked to run the class I would plan to begin in the following ways:\r\n• Having enter into the room I will greet the students and introduce myself, ask questions about the identity of the class and topic of the session. \r\n• Show the picture/photograph of a patient with burn injury as an aid to attract attention.\r\n• Ask them what is the injury and how could it happen to set the mood. \r\n• I will ask to a few of them to share their experience of patients seen with burn injury to establish rapport.\r\n• Motivation and enthusiasm- I will portray the epidemiology of burn situation in Bangladesh and global scenario. \r\n• Identify prior knowledge on the anatomy and functions of the skin, discuss features of dehydration.\r\n• Inform the objectives and the key points.\r\n• Usefulness of the session in reading, assessing and managing patient with burn injury \r\n• I will show my interest and commitment to the topic by being expressive \r\nIII. The professor could have dealt with the situation at the back of the class in the following ways: \r\n• Go to the far end (back) of the class keeping the projector slide on, look at the slide from the back, try to identify anything wrong with the visibility or room environment, if found could apologies and restructure the style immediately and if possible correct the physical environment of the room. \r\n• If no problem is found with the slide, talk to the students whether he is in the right topic in the right class or have the students any problem at the back, if any, that is correctable- manage accordingly; if not correctable immediately- accommodate the back benchers in the front rows.\r\n• If any problem found in the room environment which is not immediately correctable- reschedule the lecture for another day.  \r\nIV. I think showing the burning village was not appropriate with the topic. Because: \r\n• Having little relevance with the topic.\r\n• Rather it could be distracting, divert attention of the students to regional, political and humanitarian issue instead of learning ‘burn’.\r\n• Could lead the students to fall into debate.\r\n• It might be traumatic for some students.\r\nI would like to use a photograph of a patient with non-fatal burn injury having areas of deep and superficial burn to stimulate students’ interest on the following: \r\n• What would be the first-aid measures for this patient\r\n• ABCDE of advanced trauma live support (ATLS)\r\n• Cooling of the burned area \r\n• Fluid resuscitation of this patient \r\n Measurement of the area of the burn\r\n Measurement of body weight\r\n Calculation of the fluid volume\r\n Type of fluid (crystaloid, colloid, blood)\r\n• Associated injuries that may be seen in the photograph to be identified \r\n• Does this patient need admission to the hospital\r\n• Local management of this wound \r\n• Complications that my follow at this particular area of burn and measures to prevent them \r\n\r\n2. Yes, an interactive lecture can be implemented in a class of 150 students.\r\nFollowing measures may be effective: \r\n• Prior to lecture, inform student the topic (class schedule, study guide, website)\r\n• At introduction of the lecture\r\n Gaining attention\r\n Inform what students will be required to learn\r\n How lecture will be related to their reading and practical activities\r\n Breaking the students up into smaller groups to promote discussion of ideas and problem solving during a lecture\r\n Engaging students through clinical cases, ask to work through a case, ask students for inputs during presentation of lecture\r\n• At body of the lecture \r\n Periodic pause and review every 10 to 15 minutes\r\n Questioning to check understanding (rhetorical question, surveys, straight forward question, brain storming, invent examples, compare with another, to consider advantages and disadvantages, strength and weaknesses, produce theory etc.)\r\n Show video clips with instructions on what to look for\r\n Allow to ask questions to clarify \r\n Half-way quizzes, setting questions/problems/task for students to do\r\n Simulation and role plays\r\n Written materials- students are asked to fill in the blanks\r\n• At conclusion towards the end of the class of the lecture, review the key points and ask them to review what they have learnt and share with their neighbors\r\nOne minute question\r\nA one minute question may be defined as a very short in class writing activity, taking one minute or less to complete in response to an instructor posed questions, which prompts students to reflect on the day’s lesson and provides the instructor with useful feedback. This strategy was developed by a physics professor at University of California (1983) and popularized by Cross and Angels (1988) as a quick classroom technique (CATs). It provides the instructors with anonymous feedback on what students are learning in the class.  \r\nIt can also be used: \r\n• As content-centered instructional feedback strategy\r\n• As a student-centered reflection strategy\r\n• To build instructor-student rapport\r\nIt can be given in addition to at the end, at other times during the class period as well, e.g. at the start of the class to activate/turn on ideas and feelings students may already have, right after discussion of a key point to trigger student reflection on that point. \r\nUse of one minute question with examples as an interactive technic in the lecture class  \r\n• Minute paper can improve quality of class discussion by having students write briefly about a concept or issue before they begin discussing it. This gives more reflective students a chance to gather their thoughts prior to verbalizing them and benefits students who are more fearful of public speaking by giving them a script to build on and use as a support structure for communicating their ideas orally.\r\n• An effective way of involving all students in the class simultaneously.\r\n• Ensures equal participation of each and every class member including anyone who may be too shy or fearful to participate orally.\r\n• Each and every student is expected to participate and has something important to contribute. Examples- during this lecture, “what thoughts came to your mind that you did not get the opportunity to share verbally?”\r\n• Can be used to stimulate and facilitate discussions of diversity e.g. interpretation or explanation of differences or similarities or aspects of a topic. \r\n• Can be used to personally validate students as individual if their comments are quoted during the presentation of the lecture. \r\n• Lecturer learn students’ names if students are asked to come up to the front of the room individually to turn in their minute papers and if the students are called by names. \r\n• Serve to build teacher-student rapport if teacher check the minute question, respond personally by writing a comment on it and sign his name below. This communication approximates or simulates that of a personal letter.\r\n\r\n3. Dialogue in initiating and hampering interaction\r\n\r\nI. Dialogue that would be helpful in initiating interaction: \r\n\r\nX said “The girl has pain in right iliac fossa, vomited twice and raised total count of WBC and polymorphs, so it could be a case of Acute Appendicitis.” \r\nY pointed out that, “She has a history of amenorrhea, no history of central abdominal pain at the onset of symptom and looks pale, could it be a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy?”\r\nZ made a comment, “In that case a blood test for beta HCG can help.”\r\nX pointed out, “Would ultrasonography be a better option?”\r\nWhile Y suggested, “I think a CT scan may be conclusive.”\r\nW supported the suggestion and at the same time reminded, “We should not forget other possibilities to her as well.”\r\n“Considering the financial constraints of the girl, we may wait and watch her for a couple of hours, keeping her on conservative management and review thereafter” P added…………………………\r\n\r\nII. Dialogue that would be helpful in hampering interaction: \r\n\r\nA told, “This middle-aged gentleman has severe upper abdominal pain following a heavy meal, he is habituated to consume alcohol, now have tenderness and rigidity in the upper abdomen, certainly this is case of acute pancreatitis.”\r\nB added, “In that case measurement of serum amylase and lipase will confirm the diagnosis.”\r\nC screamed, “No, no CT scan will be conclusive”\r\nA suggested, “To be in the safe side, he must be managed in the ICU,”…………..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-04-14 11:41:19', 'upload/attachment/14298c52268ec595a1ca80f6ce903939.docx', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
