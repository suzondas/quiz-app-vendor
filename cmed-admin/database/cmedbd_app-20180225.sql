(7, 18, 'Development in ongoing curriculum for Psychiatry in MBBS level in Bangladesh. ', '<div xss=removed>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><span xss=removed>Asia has about\r\n25% of the world''s population. One-fifth of the mentally ill in the world live\r\nin this region but mental-health manpower is grossly inadequate</span><span xss=removed>. Most of the patient’s first contact is the\r\nprimary care physician for treatment. Unfortunately due to a deficient training\r\nat the undergraduate level, most doctors are unable to recognize and correctly\r\ntreat psychiatric disorders. The basic purpose of teaching and training at the\r\nundergraduate level is to prepare medical graduates to serve better at primary\r\nhealth-care level. The patients with physical illness have concomitant\r\nemotional problems requiring professional handling; therefore, teaching of\r\nPsychiatry at the undergraduate level becomes even more relevant and essential</span><span xss=removed>. </span><span xss=removed>Emphasis on teaching & training in\r\nPsychiatry in undergraduate curriculum is low. In many of the colleges the\r\ndepartment of Psychiatry has come into existence recently, and the faculty\r\nteaching the undergraduates is relatively junior and not fully experienced in\r\nteaching undergraduate.</span><u><span xss=removed><o></o></span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><span xss=removed>Bangladesh Medical & Dental Council (BMDC) is following the\r\ncurriculum at present that have been formed in the year 2012. If we discuss\r\nBMDC curriculum including the points stated in Davidoff 1996 model, it’s a good\r\none stating the objectives. One of the objects should be having clear knowledge\r\nabout medico legal problems regarding psychiatry and dealing effectively with\r\nchallenging patient’s weather mentally ill or not. Medico legal aspect of\r\npsychiatry should be included in content as mental health act is on the\r\nprocesses of publishing in Bangladesh. However this ongoing curriculum is a\r\ngood one regarding integrity of clinical and preclinical subject. Medical\r\nstudents are now having clinical subject classes from 2<sup>nd</sup> phase that\r\nis after first one and a half year. They get placement in clinical class of\r\nPsychiatry department for 3 weeks in 3<sup>rd</sup> phase. Another 1 or 2 weeks\r\nshould be added in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> phase which will increase\r\ntheir interest and skills to deal with mentally ill patients as well as\r\nchallenging patients or relatives or friends of the patients in some emergency\r\nsituations. Options can be Field trip or Tertiary care hospital/ De addiction clinic\r\nvisit in the 2<sup>nd</sup> phase instead of ward placement. We can add some\r\nshort scales to measure anxiety, depression and MMSE as teaching aids. Time\r\nallocated for lecture is 20 hours. Instead of lecture, or reducing the time of\r\nlectures we can adopt more Student centered, Problem based, integrated method\r\nwhich will include all the points of SPICES model and Spiral curriculum. After\r\na short discussion with my students and from my personal experience I have\r\nfound that learning by doing is the best option. We can assign 10 cases of\r\nmental illness per student from phase 2 onward for taking care as a whole and\r\nmaintaining liaisons with other departments as needed. There will be small\r\nexams in every 6 months and during the final exam they will present the cases\r\nas a follow up study. One supervisor Psychiatrist will be guide all through and\r\nthus they can learn by themselves and with interest. In assessment part my\r\nsuggestion is that one Psychiatrist must be present in a board of final exam. A\r\nformer Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang has wisely stated that “ I believe that\r\nteaching without testing is like cooking without testing”. Learning outcomes\r\ncan be measured by attitude of students towards psychiatry just after admission\r\nto medical college and after final exam. Many studies have shown that proper\r\nexposure to Psychiatry changes the attitude of student towards positive.</span><span xss=removed> </span><span xss=removed>Tharyan <i>et al.,</i> in their study, observed that exposure\r\nto psychiatry training did have an influence on the change in attitude to\r\nmental illness, though it did not influence the choice of career. Rao <i>et\r\nal.</i> did a prospective study to elicit and monitor over time the medical\r\nstudents'' attitudes to psychiatry, psychiatrists, psychiatric patients and\r\ntheir treatment. There was a significant shift in favorable direction in the\r\ngeneral attitude to psychiatry, both before and after training. Majority of\r\nthem considered psychiatric specialty as challenging and scientific, and almost\r\nall felt that too little time is being spent on psychiatry in UG curriculum.\r\nHowever regarding educational environment, Psychiatry departments in all\r\nmedical colleges should be strengthened with a minimum strength of 20 beds and\r\na minimum faculty consisting of one professor, one associate professor and two\r\nasst. professors/lecturers.<o></o></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><span xss=removed>Psychiatry curriculum has obvious gap in the declared and taught part\r\nthat can be rectified only if policy and decision makers recognize the\r\nimportance of Psychiatry, not only in medical education but also in primary\r\nhealth care. The basic problem is that students can feel and empathize for the\r\nphysically ill, but they are overwhelmed by fear when they see the mentally ill.\r\nThe objective of undergraduate psychiatric education should be to equip medical\r\nstudents with core psychiatric knowledge useful in daily medical practice\r\nrather than filling curriculum time. Students are overloaded with brain\r\nchemistry, neurotransmitters research data on psychoses but are starved of\r\nrecognition of anxiety states, depression in non-psychiatric medical settings. Primary-care\r\npsychiatric problems, anxiety, depression are in abundance in primary-care\r\nclinics and medical wards where Psychiatry is to be taught in MBBS level. The\r\nundergraduates may be taught the psychiatric manifestations of common physical\r\ndisorders like delirium, which is found in abundance in medical and surgical\r\nwards. In most of the medical colleges of this region, knowledge of psychiatric\r\nillnesses is not evaluated in the examinations, psychiatric cases are not kept\r\nin clinical examination and viva voce part also seldom covers Psychiatry. Long-term\r\nplans should focus on reforming undergraduate medical education to incorporate\r\nexpanded, structured training in Psychiatry so that M.B.B.S. doctors are well\r\nprepared for the high standards of postgraduate training and examinations. The\r\nfuture doctor should be sympathetic towards patients with psychological\r\ncomplaints, be able to detect mental disorders and treat simple cases and be\r\naware when to seek a specialist''s help. <o></o></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><span xss=removed><o> </o></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><span xss=removed>References-<o></o></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div><div xss=removed>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" xss=removed>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;<span xss=removed>1.<span xss=removed>    </span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<span xss=removed>Trivedi JK, Goel D, Kallivaylil RA, Isaac M,\r\nShrestha DM, Gambheera HC.

curriculum in\r\nNephrology and ways of improving and implementation of these weaknesses in\r\ncurrent situation</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Objectives:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol xss=removed start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal" xss=removed>Evaluation of current MBBS curriculum in\r\n     nephrology</li><li class="MsoNormal" xss=removed>Ways of improvement and implementation of\r\n     suggestions for further development</li></ol>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Introduction:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Curriculum is the blueprint that entails the goals of any\r\neducational activity and endeavor to achieve the goal. It is known that ten\r\nbasic questions need to be considered before planning the curriculum and there\r\nremain five aspects of a curriculum. There should be a core and electives.\r\nDepending up on these basic facts in curriculum, the existing MBBS curriculum is\r\nevaluated and an attempt is made to further improve it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Given/current\r\ncurriculum:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In the 2012 curriculum, in urinary system there remain five\r\ntopics namely glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury,\r\nchronic kidney disease and urinary tract infection and the set learning objectives\r\nare there. Integrated teaching included rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis and\r\nnephrotic syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Overall\r\nstrength:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC) is having a\r\ncurriculum with its defined learning objectives. May it not be flaw-less, but\r\nits presence and practice is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Now the evaluation of nephrology part in detail is presented.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Need assessment:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The current curriculum is sufficiently justified in\r\nfulfilling the community needs. It encompassed the common renal diseases\r\nidentifiable in community that may be treated in primary care and some patients\r\nwill require secondary and tertiary care level services. Still there should be\r\na room for further improvements in need assessment especially by critical\r\nincident studies for example star fruit (kamranga) can cause acute kidney\r\ninjury. So, it might be included in future that common edible agents with\r\nnephrotoxic potentials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Aims and\r\nobjectives:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In the existing curriculum, the objectives are clearly\r\nmentioned. So, there is very little, if any, to improve in this area, rather to\r\nme, there remain some areas of specialists’ concern like arterio-venous\r\nfistula, renal allografts etc. which, probably might not be in core rather\r\nshould be in electives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Contents:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The contents of existing curriculum included acute kidney\r\ninjury, chronic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome and\r\nurinary tract infection. These broad areas of renal diseases are quiet\r\nsufficient to address the community needs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Organization\r\nof contents:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Because of the vertical organization of current curriculum,\r\nclinically relevant basic subjects are incorporated in first two academic\r\nyears, then in fourth year students are to learn para-clinical subjects. If a\r\nhorizontal integration could be made especially in to topics like\r\npost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections to involve\r\nmedicine, nephrology, paediatrics, patology, microbiology, pharmacology,\r\ncommunity medicine in integrated teaching, definitely it could achieve a better\r\nlearning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Educational\r\nstrategies:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding the educational strategies, there is very little\r\nin writing. This appears to be of discipline based and opportunistic. If\r\ndirection is given towards problem based and integrated, then it would be\r\nbetter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Teaching\r\nmethods to be used: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Little is known from the existing, 2012 undergraduate\r\nmedical curriculum, regarding use of teaching methods. If broad areas of\r\nnephrology in this curriculum are to be evaluated, all 5 topics are for large\r\ngroup teaching especially lectures (5 hours). So, definitely power-point\r\npresentation is to be used. If we consider the learning objectives, then small\r\ngroup teaching at bed side by demonstrating the real patient would result in\r\nbetter learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Assessment:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Very little is extracted from the current curriculum\r\nregarding assessment in nephrology except one Item in card 1. If a clear\r\ndistribution in assessment might be made like topics to be covered in bed side clinical\r\nexamination for example nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and theory\r\nlike anaemia management of chronic kidney disease etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Communication\r\nof the curriculum:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">There is an existing curriculum but is poorly communicated\r\nto all (if any) clinical teachers and students of respective course. It is\r\nprobably because of ignorance of the presence of curriculum by many clinical\r\nteachers. Many clinical staffs do not know how much is to teach to a 3<sup>rd</sup>\r\nyear clinical placement or a 5<sup>th</sup> year clinical placement. Students\r\ndo not know the existence of the curriculum. So, this communication should be\r\nemphasized for both teachers and students to attain a better learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Educational\r\nenvironment:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In resource-constrain setting like ours, the appropriate\r\nattainment of an appropriate educational environment is often impossible. During\r\na bedside teaching, it is almost impossible to create a calm environment. It is\r\nquiet impossible to give proper attention to 24-30 students, or supervise or\r\nteach examination techniques/skills to all students in a single 2 hour clinical\r\nclass. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Management\r\nof the overall process:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In the light of five basic aspects of curriculum namely\r\naims, content, organization of contents, learning methods and assessment, the\r\n2012 undergraduate medical curriculum encompassing nephrology addressed almost\r\nall areas. But, there are weaknesses in descriptions of learning methods to be\r\nused for given tasks and ways of assessment. A better description in these\r\nareas is likely to bring about an expected learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Conclusion:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Curriculum is a dynamic theme. Always there remains a scope\r\nfor improvement. The overall weakness of the curriculum is the inadequacy in given\r\ntime for development of communication skills, lack of evaluation and feedback\r\nby the students regarding the course and teachers. For implementation of the newly\r\n(in this assignment) proposed activities, a subject committee may be formed to\r\nidentify areas for further improvement. These proposals might be communicated\r\nwith the medicine department and phase 3 meetings. Ultimately at national level,\r\nduring curriculum development, these issues should be raised and incorporated (if\r\nfound logical by arguments) in undergraduate medical curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-19 18:49:04', 'upload/attachment/29c9d51121409bca4e7335a7b3f5f558.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Introduction:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Curriculum refers to a series of planned activities intended\r\nto bring about specific learning outcomes in the student. There are ten basic\r\nquestions are considered before planning a curriculum and there remain five\r\naspects of a curriculum. Depending up on these basic facts in curriculum the\r\nexisting MBBS curriculum is evaluated and an attempt is made to improve it.<span xss=removed></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Given/current\r\ncurriculum:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In the 2012 curriculum, in urinary system there remain five\r\ntopics namely glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury,\r\nchronic kidney disease and urinary tract infection. And the set learning objectives\r\nare there. Integrated teaching included rheumatic fever and nephrotic syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Overall\r\nstrength:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council have a curriculum with\r\nits defined learning objectives. May it not be flaw free, but its presence and\r\npractice is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Now the evaluation Nephrology part in detail is presented. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Need\r\nassessment:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The current curriculum is sufficiently justified in\r\nfulfilling the community needs. It encompassed the common renal diseases\r\nidentifiable in community that may be treated in primary care and some patients\r\nwill require secondary and tertiary care level services. Still there should be\r\na room for further improvements in need assessment especially by critical\r\nincident studies for example star fruit can cause acute kidney injury. So, it\r\nmight be included in future that common edible agents with nephrotoxic\r\npotentials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Aims and\r\nobjectives:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In the existing curriculum, the objectives are clearly\r\nmentioned. So, there is very little, if any, to improve in this area, rather to\r\nme, there remain some areas of specialists’ concern like arterio-venous\r\nfistula, renal allografts etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Contents:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The contents of existing curriculum included AKI, CKD,\r\nglomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome and urinary tract infection. These broad\r\nareas of renal diseases are quiet sufficient to address the community needs.\r\nEmerging diseases are to be emphasis in future. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Organization\r\nof contents:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Because of the vertical organization of current curriculum,\r\nclinically relevant basic subjects are incorporated in first two academic\r\nyears, and then in fourth year students are to learn Para clinical subjects. If\r\na horizontal integration could be made especially in to topics like\r\npost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infections to involve\r\nmedicine, nephrology, pediatrics, pathology, microbiology, pharmacology,\r\ncommunity medicine in integrated teaching, definitely it could achieve a better\r\nlearning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Educational\r\nstrategies:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">This appears to be of discipline based. If direction is\r\ngiven towards problem based and integrated, then it would be better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Teaching\r\nmethods to be used: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In the present curriculum 5 hours are allocated to cover\r\nmajor parts of nephrology related topics. It will be more helpful to the\r\nstudent if it is problem solving and improvement in communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Assessment:</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Very little is extracted from the current curriculum\r\nregarding assessment in nephrology except one Item in card 1. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Communication\r\nof the curriculum:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">There is an existing curriculum but is not communicated at\r\nall (if any) to clinical teachers and students of respective course. It is\r\nprobably because of ignorance of the presence of curriculum by many clinical\r\nteachers. Many clinical staffs do not know how much is to teach to a 3<sup>rd</sup>\r\nyear clinical placement or a 5<sup>th</sup> year clinical placement. Students\r\ndo not know the existence of the curriculum. So, this communication should be\r\nemphasized for both teachers and student to attain a better learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Educational\r\nenvironment:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In resource-constrain setting like ours the appropriate\r\nattainment of an appropriate educational environment is often impossible. During\r\na bedside teaching, it is almost impossible to create a calm environment. It is\r\nquiet impossible to give proper attention to 24 students, or supervise or teach\r\nexamination technique to all student in a single 2 hour class. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Management\r\nof the overall process:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">In the light of five basic aspects of curriculum namely\r\naims, content, organization of contents, learning methods and assessment, the\r\n2012 undergraduate medical curriculum encompassing nephrology addresses almost\r\nall areas. But, there are weaknesses in descriptions of learning methods to be\r\nused for given tasks and ways of assessment. A better description in these\r\nareas is likely to bring about an expected learning outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><span xss=removed>Conclusion:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Overall weakness of the curriculum is the inadequacy in\r\ngiven time for development of communication skills, lack of evaluation and feedback\r\nby the students regarding the course and teachers. For implementation of the\r\nproposed activities, a subject committee may be formed to identify areas for\r\nfurther improvement. These proposals might be communicated with the medicine\r\ndepartment and phase 3 meetings. Ultimately at national level during curriculum\r\ndevelopment these issues should be raised and incorporated in undergraduate\r\nmedical curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-19 07:16:28', 'upload/attachment/fdad3205523624b7683b3e9a9dc36ac0.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

It was a\r\ngeneral opinion of faculty members that students should learn about the\r\nabnormalities in clinical biochemistry. Short case histories followed by\r\nformulation of relevant investigations, interpretations of laboratory results,\r\ndiagnosis of disease and various metabolisms involved were suggested as\r\nadditions to the practical biochemistry curriculum.

And the number of\r\nstudents in each lecture class vary from medical college to college that is\r\nfrom Govt.Medical college to private medical college .On an average there is\r\nmore than hundred students in a lecture class. As a result, it is not possible\r\nfor a teacher to achieve better interaction with the students to reach the\r\ndesired teaching goals. The students also lose concentration and become tired\r\nof the teaching method .In that case my suggestion is to increase the tutorial\r\nhours where small group teaching is obtained and the teacher and the students\r\nhave close contact with each other.

The students however are not able to interpret the results of modern\r\nparameters used in the diagnosis of the diseases even after becoming doctors\r\nbecause the current curriculum does not include new and advanced biomarkers.\r\nAlso, there is no awareness of how the modern parameters can be used in the\r\ndiagnostic laboratories, and how to interpret them in relation with the\r\nclinical cases.

Various aspects and specialties of Surgery are included in the “curriculum for undergraduate medical Education in Bangladesh--updated 2012”, approved by Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BM & DC). </p><p><br></p><p>STRENGTHS OF THE CURRICULUM</p><p>GOAL, AIMS &OBJECTIVES</p><p>At the beginning of main curriculum National goal and objectives of MBBS course, learning out comes/ competences of fresh graduates are described comprehensively. These descriptions of goal, objectives are equally applicable to all clinical subjects including surgery and allied subjects. These descriptions give a clear idea to teachers, students and other stake holders, of the need, goal, purpose, objectives and competences of our medical graduates who will undergo successfully through this curriculum to become a graduate (MBBS) doctor. The curriculum is based on traditional method in sequential manner, not integrated.</p><p>Curriculum of surgery is discipline based. Departmental objectives of surgery department are out lined at the beginning of surgery and Allied Subjects chapter of the curriculum. In departmental objectives of surgery discipline the aim of leaning surgery on the basis of need is outlined. A list of competences/abilities to perform certain tasks (physical, verbal, communication, thinking, manipulative) is short listed under the headings of clinical, communication, Managerial and Manipulative and Practical skills.</p><p>Departmental objectives are good guidelines for teachers and concerned persons to conduct the teaching – learning programme to students with a definite aim.   </p><p>A guideline of teaching learning methods, teaching aids, in course (formative) assessment procedures are mentioned in tabular from. Equipments and appliances necessary to demonstrate and teach the students surgery and allied subjects are comprehensively listed, which is of great help to the department to collect and keep the things ready for demonstration. </p><p>Course contents and learning objectives are given in details. Course contents are divided in to different systems of surgery and allied subjects .Contents are divided in to core and additional according to priority of learning objectives. Contents are distributed at various phases (year) of study in stepwise from basic to advanced. Duration/ time is allocated for different topics of course contents, which help the department and the concerned teachers to plan the lessons (lesson-plan). In learning objectives against each system or topic, what a student should be able to know, state, perform, are mentioned clearly. This part of curriculum is of great help to student to know, what to learn, and to teachers what and how to teach.</p><p>CONTENTS AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT</p><p>Class performance record cards are prescribed for clinical (bed-side teaching), practical and tutorial teaching-learning .Under each heading several relevant topics are listed in the card for teaching learning.</p><p>Different cards are to be learned in different phases (year) of study from basic to advance level of learning. After teaching and learning a topic there is assessment/evaluation, the result of which is noted in a box against the name of the topic. On completion/end of the card it is easily can be seen whether all the topics are covered and the overall performance of the student. There is provision for final/card completion examination and to note down the result in the card, with attendance of the student. This is as established and well coordinated method of formative assessment.</p><p><br></p><p>Though the curriculum is not based on integrated method, but integrated teaching is included only for few common topics. Topics of integrated teaching are listed and instructed to schedule once in a month involving as many as possible specialties. This type of teaching definitely increases the interest of student in learning the subject.</p><p>A mixed educational strategies are adopted in this curriculum.</p><p>A summary in tabular form of the duration of lectures demonstrations, tutorials, clinical/ bed side teaching in  various phases (year of study period) of various specialties of surgery and allied along with time allotted for block posting, formative exam and summative exam is given for at a glance review of the whole curriculum which helps the department to prepare an academic calendar.</p><p>SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT METHODS AND PROCEDURES</p><p>At the end of the curriculum, different aspects and methods of summative assessment (final professional examination) of surgery are outlined. Assessment is an essential part of curriculum, without mentioning the assessment method a curriculum remains incomplete. The results of assessment in terms of different grades of marks are well mentioned.  How the assessment is performed both teacher and student should know thoroughly. In this chapter it is well described. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>WEAKNESS OF THE CURRICULUM</p><p>This curriculum is based on traditional method and discipline based.  In classical traditional method students start learning surgery after finishing the learning of subjects of basic science(anatomy, physiology, biochemistry) and applied science (pathology, microbiology, pharmacology). But in this curriculum students start learning clinical subjects like surgery and medicine after finishing the course of anatomy, physiology and biochemistry in Phase -II. Pathology, microbiology and Pharmacology are taught in phase-III one year after starting the clinical subjects. Without a basic knowledge of these subjects teaching – learning of surgery is difficult. In Phase –II forensic medicine and community medicine are included, to learn these subjects knowledge of  pathology, microbiology and pharmacology is also essential. In this curriculum sequence of learning is not well maintained.</p><p>Topics mentioned in surgery curriculum is wide open and no limitation of knowledge is demarcated, as result the teachers may not be able to limit their knowledge dissemination, and information overload occurs frequently. So topics should be made more specified regarding the limit and depth of knowledge.</p><p>In the curriculum there are some discrepancies in teaching hours. </p><p><br></p><p>To improve and implement the curriculum of surgery at the institutional level, the following points are to be considered actively:</p><p><br></p><p>1.<span xss=removed> </span>All the teachers of the surgery and allied subjects should have knowledge about the curriculum, particularly regarding related subject of the concerned teacher. To disseminate the knowledge of the curriculum and an action plan to set, a departmental workshop can be arranged at the beginning of each session. </p><p>2.<span xss=removed> </span>To follow the quality assurance scheme designed by Centre for Medical Education is a prescribed way to monitor the curriculum implementation in an institute.  </p><p><br></p><p>COMMUNICATIONS OF CURRICULUM</p><p>3.<span xss=removed> </span>Students should be well informed regarding the curriculum in brief including formative and summative assessment methods and procedures, so that they can participate and contribute by periodical feedback of the progress and any difficulty they face.</p><p>4.<span xss=removed> </span>An academic calendar of the department for each batch/session of students should be prepared well ahead of starting the class.</p><p>5.<span xss=removed> </span>A study guide with a list of learning resources and list of standard text books suggested by faculty members should be handed over to students for study at the beginning of session.</p><p><br></p><p>TEACHING METHODS</p><p>6.<span xss=removed> </span>Lectures are to be interactive.</p><p>7.<span xss=removed> </span>A lesson plan for lecture class to be prepared with an idea to avoid information overload.</p><p>8.<span xss=removed> </span>Small group teachings are to be included in the class routine for more interactive discussion.</p><p>9.<span xss=removed> </span>Integrated teaching is to be arranged as per schedule and on the topic prescribed in the curriculum.</p><p>10.<span xss=removed> </span> Pathology, Microbiology and Pharmacology are not included in Phase –II, but clinical subject surgery classes start in Phase-II. It is difficult to continue teaching –learning programme of surgery without some basic knowledge of Pathology, Microbiology and Pharmacology. So arrangement should be made for some classes of the mentioned subjects in class routine of Phase-II, in consultation with heads of the mentioned department of the subjects to facilitate the teaching –learning programme.</p><p><br></p><p>ASSESSMENT</p><p>11.<span xss=removed> </span>Prescribed periodic formative assessment should be arranged and conducted as per schedule, and the results are to be announced for feedback of performance of students and as well as evaluation of teaching performance.</p><p>12.<span xss=removed> </span>A rehearsal of summative assessment should be arranged to familiar the students with the methods of  summative assessment at the end of the course.</p><p><br></p><p>REVIEW AND FEEDBACK</p><p>13.<span xss=removed> </span>All the teachers of the department should meet once in a month on a fixed date to discuss the progress, problems, and find out the solution and any correction in schedule.</p><p>14.<span xss=removed> </span>Members of the faculty will provide in writing the difficulties or deficiencies they face during conducting the course in curriculum to head of the faculty time to time. Head of the faculty will compile them and report it to appropriate authority or present in forums of national curriculum development.</p><p>A.E.MD.ABDUL WASEY</p><div><br></div>', '2018-01-23 12:28:57', NULL, '<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Positive:<o></o></b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Timely submitted<o></o></p><p class="MsoNormal">Properly submitted<o></o></p><p class="MsoNormal">The introduction with the statement of basic understanding\r\nabout the curriculum is appropriately written.<o></o></p><p class="MsoNormal">Most of the components of a curriculum is touched.<o></o></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Challenges:<o></o></b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Volume:  Expected in 800\r\nwords.

The\r\ncontents are well documented and well organized. The starting is as traditional\r\nmedical curriculum while basic sciences are taught for one and a half year in\r\nphase I, whereas, spirally integrated in subsequent phases (II, III, and IV) so\r\nthat competence of the students increases with each visit to a topic. The\r\nstrategy adopted in this curriculum is a mixture of approaches both innovative\r\n(SPICES) and traditional. Teaching methods are logically arranged including\r\nlectures, tutorials, practical, demonstrations, clinical and bed-side teaching.\r\nIt also included integrated teaching for twenty hours in each course.\r\nManipulative and practical skills are precisely listed which covers most of the\r\nrequirements in surgical patient management. Small group teaching included\r\ntutorials, problem-based learning, clinical demonstrations (OPD/Indoor), attending\r\nand observing minor operations, demonstrations of X-rays and specimens,\r\nobservation in ICU and post-operative ward, case presentation and discussions.\r\nThere are provision of assignments and scope of self-study. Traditional and\r\nmodern teaching aids are suggested to use namely chalk & board, OHP,\r\nspecimens, plain & contrast X-rays of various systems, ultrasonograph,\r\nisotope scan, CT scan, MRI, computer, multimedia, photographs and videos,\r\nmodels etc. Assessment portion is also well organized namely item examination,\r\ncard final and term examination, final examination (written, oral, practical,\r\nclinical). The whole syllabus is organized with a precise time-table in each\r\nacademic calendar. This curriculum also included the topic those were not\r\naddressed in the previous one like communication skills, professional attitude\r\nand understanding of ethical principles, preventive and palliative care etc. <o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><b><span xss=removed>Limitations:  <o></o></span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><span xss=removed>The\r\nsurgical needs in our community is not outlined, instead, a vague term “common\r\nsurgical problems” was used which remains on the discretions of the faculties,\r\nhence, very much subjective one. I think the term “common” must be precisely\r\ndefined and specified, otherwise, a common problem to one may seem to be rare\r\nto another faculty. For example, Cystic Hygroma though rare in our country get\r\nmuch importance in teaching and examination while infective problems other than\r\nabscess including surgical site infections get least importance. A study of\r\nerrors and critical incidence studies are neglected in the contents. To give\r\nimportance to a wide range of allied subjects, the contents are overcrowded\r\ncreating burden to the students and compel to surface learning. Much time is\r\nallocated for lectures (five hundred and twenty hours) while only sixty-two hours\r\nfor clinical/bed-side teaching. This makes theoretical giant and practical\r\ndwarf doctors.  Educational environment\r\nis detailed but practically this environment is very difficult to achieve and\r\nmaintain without supervision so there are great variations of educational\r\nenvironment among medical colleges. Moreover, there is no guideline regarding\r\ntutorial rooms, wards, and patient-student ratio. That is why students of a\r\nlarge number of medical colleges have poor clinical and practical exposure. The\r\ncurriculum management portion is also much neglected. There is no guideline to\r\nstaff requirements, teacher-student ratio and staff development program. So,\r\nthough the curriculum is new teachers remained traditional and inadequate.\r\nLogistical support requirements are not defined and there are great variations\r\namong institutions. Thus, questions adopted in examinations lack variations,\r\npractically most of the questions are set from questions bank. Evaluation\r\nsystem is theoretically upgraded but difficult to implement in most\r\ninstitutions because of inadequate teaching and support staffs. Marks in\r\nformative assessment is very small and subjective. This discourages students’\r\nday to day learning. There is nothing about academic standards and quality\r\nassurance in this curriculum. So, there are gaps among the declared curriculum,\r\ntaught curriculum and learned curriculum. <o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><b><span xss=removed>Conclusions:<o></o></span></b></p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p class="MsoNormal" xss=removed><span xss=removed>Despite\r\nhaving much strength in many aspects of the new curriculum, difficulty in\r\nimplementation, lack of standards among institutions, inadequate arrangement\r\nfor continuous staff development, disharmonious assessment, and insufficient\r\nacademic standards and quality assurance have converted this curriculum\r\npractically to a little better than a syllabus.

(46, 32, 'importance of taxonomy & learning objective in educational program', 'Importance of taxonomy and learning objective:\r\nEducation is the process involving to facilitate learning, the chief goal of which is to bring about change in the behavior.  The sort of behavioral changes that the school attempts to bring about constitute the educational objectives.  Taxonomies of learning are the hierarchical classification in the field of education, have been developed by various groups concern with educational problems to help teachers to formulate precisely the educational objective. Taxonomy guides in grouping of objectives into types of learning capabilities utilized to plan the conditions required for successful learning, to determine the sequence of a segment of course to formulate instructional design and evaluation system.  The taxonomy guides all about in an educational program.  The important taxonomy are Bloom''s Taxonomy, SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of Observed Learning Outcome) and McGuire preparation for achievement test. Educational psychologist consider three working levels of taxonomy to satisfy the need of evaluation.  The framework elaborated by Bloom and his colleague consist of six major categories: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. Bloom classifies educational objectives into three domains, namely:\r\n1. The cognitive or mental skills (Knowledge) domain.\r\n2. The Affective or emotional (Attitude) domain.\r\n3. The psychomotor or physical skills domain.\r\nThe cognitive domain:\r\nThe cognitive domain refers to categories related to knowledge, comprehension, and critical thinking of a particular topic. Bloom classified these categories into six levels, moving through the lowest order processes to the highest:\r\ni. Knowledge\r\nRecalling facts, terms, basic concepts and answers. \r\nVerbs: arrange, define, duplicate, label, list, memorize, name, order, recognize, relate, recall, repeat, reproduce, state.\r\nii. Comprehension\r\nDemonstrative understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating main ideas. \r\nVerbs: classify, describe, discuss, explain, express, identify, indicate, locate, recognize, report, restate, review, select, translate.\r\niii. Application\r\nUsing new knowledge. Applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules in a different way.\r\nVerbs: apply, choose, demonstrate, dramatize, employ, illustrate, interpret, operate, practice, schedule, sketch, solve, use, write.\r\niv. Analysis\r\nExamine and break information into parts.\r\nVerbs: analyze, appraise, calculate, categorize, compare, contrast, criticize, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test.\r\nv. Synthesis\r\nAssemble information together in a different way by combining elements in a new pattern or proposing alternative solutions.\r\nVerbs: arrange, assemble, collect, compose, construct, create, design, develop, formulate, manage, organize, plan, prepare, propose, set up, write.\r\nvi. Evaluation\r\nAssessing value, making judgments about information, validity of ideas or quality of work.\r\nVerbs: appraise, argue, assess, attach, choose compare, defend estimate, judge, predict, rate, core, select, support, value, evaluate.\r\nThe Affective domain:\r\nThe target in the affective domain is awareness and growth in attitudes, emotion, and feelings – emotional reaction and ability to feel another living thing’s pain or joy. Five levels are identified in the affective domain moving through the lowest order processes to the highest:\r\ni.Receiving\r\nThe lowest level; the student passively pays attention. Without this level no learning can occur.\r\nii.Responding\r\nNot only does the student attend the learning process but also responds and participates in some way.\r\niii.Valuing\r\nSeeing worth in new information\r\niv.Organizing\r\nFitting the new information into existing schema and deciding how the new information makes sense for you\r\nv.Characterizing\r\nMaking the new information part of your schema and exhibiting new behavior, attitude or belief\r\nThe Psychomotor domain:\r\nThe Psychomotor Domain is skill based and refers to the learning of skills. Physical skills are the ability to move, act, or manually manipulate the body to perform a physical movement. There are  three levels in the psychomotor domain according to RH Dave (1967)\r\nImportance of taxonomy include the following:\r\ni. Bloom’s taxonomy provides a universally effective strategy for creating all type of content to impart learning.\r\nii. The taxonomy helps teachers make decisions about the classification of content.\r\niii. Taxonomy also helps teachers map content to tasks that students need to perform.\r\niv. Taxonomy guides teachers to develop higher levels of thinking process for critical thinking or creative thinking.\r\nv. Using the taxonomy a teacher develops questions or projects that require the development of thinking and reflection from the knowledge level to the evaluation level.\r\nvi. A teacher or a syllabus designer designs a curriculum as well as classroom assignment using taxonomy to advance the learning process from recalling learning materials to higher level of thinking.\r\nvii. A teacher creates class activities based on Taxonomy.\r\nImportance of learning objective include the following:\r\nI. It provides directions to the instructor and it clearly conveys his instructional intent to others.\r\nII. It provides a guide for selecting the subject matter, the teaching method and the materials to be used during instruction.\r\nIII. It provides a guide for constructing tests and other instruments for evaluating student achievement.\r\nIV. If the expected learning outcomes are conveyed to the students, these outcomes also serve as a guide for the students learning activities.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives on  “study of tumour” according to the hierarchies in each learning domain:\r\n1. KNOWLEDGE: Define and classify tumour.\r\n2. COMPREHENSION: Compare between benign and malignant tumour.\r\n3. APPLICATION: Which type of tumour is harmful for the body?.\r\n4. ANALYSIS: List four causes why the malignant tumours are harmful for the body. \r\n5. SYNTHESIS: Explain the benefits of benign tumour over malignant tumour by method or routs of metastasis.\r\n6. EVALUATION: Do you feel that early diagnosis of tumour can reduce the morbidity and mortality?.\r\n', '2018-01-28 18:11:59', 'upload/attachment/32c909ba0f848a871b76b905dadf8635.docx', '<p>You need to write 3 hierarchies in each learning domain and 5 learning capabilities that human can learn.

(54, 48, 'Describe importance of taxonomy & learning objective in educational program. Write at least 5 specific objectives on any topic of your speciality according to the hierarchies in each learning domain', 'Assignment\r\nA helpful way to approach any challenge is to use a taxonomy as a guideline. A taxonomy is just a fancy term for the practice and science of classification. Taxonomies are developed to provide a framework for organizing a continuum along an underlying structure. \r\nTaxonomies of learning are the hierarchical classification in the field of education, have been developed by various groups concern with educational problems to help teachers to formulate precisely the educational objective. \r\nThe important taxonomies are Bloom''s Taxonomy, SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of Observed Learning Outcome) and McGuire preparation for achievement test. Educational psychologist consider three working levels of taxonomy to satisfy the need of evaluation\r\nIn 1956, Dr. Benjamin Bloom and several other educational psychologists published set of guidelines for developing educational objectives. Known as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this framework clarified the different stages of learning into three main domains: cognitive, psychomotor and affective.\r\nBloom’s taxonomy primarily provides instructors with a focus for developing their course learning objectives. It can be used to increase one''s understanding of the educational process. \r\nBloom''s taxonomy was developed to provide a common language for teachers to discuss and exchange learning and assessment methods. \r\n      Importance of taxonomy in educational program:\r\n1)  Taxonomy is a helpful tool in writing objectives and identifying how well the students comprehend a concept. \r\n2) It indicates the type of learning outcome that should be considered and it also provides a framework for classifying those outcomes.\r\n3) Specific learning objectives can be derived from the taxonomy, though it is most commonly used to assess learning on a variety of cognitive levels.\r\n4) It helps to determine the sequence of a segment of course to formulate instructional design and evaluation system.\r\n5) It also help educators focus on all three domains when teaching, thus creating a much more holistic form of education that can fit different learning styles and increase retention.\r\n6) It encourages higher-order thought in the students by building up from lower-level cognitive skills.\r\n7)  It also helps in Knowing the different levels and looking for where students fall among them  that will enable the fascilitators to move them from a basic level of understanding to a more complex level. \r\n8) This understanding facilitates the prioritizing of material and can steer the organization of lessons to maximize class time. For example, lower-level skills (e.g., memorizing factual knowledge) can be developed before higher-level skills are introduced (e.g., analysis of relationships).\r\n9) Beyond writing objectives, taxonomy is also extremely helpful in assessing students’ understanding of concepts.\r\n10) Taxonomy can be used as a checklist to ensure that all levels of a domain have been assessed and align assessment methods with the appropriate lessons and methodologies.\r\n11) It provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs.\r\nThe taxonomy guides all about in an educational program.\r\nIn this way, the taxonomy also makes it easier for instructors to maintain consistency between assessment methods, content and instructional materials and identify weak areas.\r\nLearning objectives are also called instructional objectives or performance objectives. They are the statements that describe what students will be able to do once they successfully complete a unit of instruction .\r\n Learning objectives are goals, not the activities performed to achieve those goals.\r\nA good learning objective is specific, measurable, and clearly stated. Learning objectives are a critical component of instruction. It describes the learner behavior It describes the behavior that can be seen or heard. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum.\r\n     Importance of learning objective educational program :\r\n1. It provides a guideline for content\r\n2. Helps in preparing a lesson plan\r\n3. Provide course developers guidance on selecting suitable: \r\no instructional materials;\r\no teaching methods, including learning activities and use of technology;\r\no assessment methods.\r\n4. Help students focus on what they are expected to learn, and understand how they will be assessed.\r\n5. It provides a guideline of evaluation\r\n6. A clearly stated learning objective can help an instructor create appropriate learning activities to help students acquire the desired skills and select good assessment tools to evaluate students'' achievement.\r\nThat’s why it is always emphasized that learning objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, transferable. Learning objectives target knowledge, skills or attitudes for change. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum\r\n\r\nI am from Biochemistry specialty and my topic is “Clinical Biochemistry and Endocrinology”\r\nFrom cognitive domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Define bilirubin and state different types of serum bilirubin\r\n• Explain the mechanism of development of hyperbilirubinaemia\r\n• State the indication of measurement of serum bilirubin\r\n• Differentiate different types of jaundice from serum bilirubin level\r\n• State the other biomarkers to differentiate different types of jaundice\r\nFrom psychomotor domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Asses the subject whether he is ready for the procedure (estimation of serum bilirubin)\r\n• Collect specimen properly from the appropriate site without any complication\r\n• Perform the test properly by using appropriate reagent and instruments\r\n• Interpret the test results\r\nFrom Affective domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Attend the subject properly and listen his complains\r\n• State the subject about the importance of the test regarding his condition\r\n• Correlate the test result with the pathological condition\r\n• support the subject mentally\r\nEducational objectives are short, well structured statements that specifies what the learners are expected to achieve at the end of an educational program.\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-28 05:24:44', 'upload/attachment/125dd0434d1b2c69a31b47a7a7e83a94.doc', '<p class="MsoNormal" xss="removed" xss=removed><span xss="removed">Dear fellow<o></o></span></p><p xss="removed" xss=removed><span xss="removed">Thanks for your much effort for preparing  assignment.

To highlight the importance of taxonomy and learning objectives in educational program\r\n2. Example of a topic in nephrology with objectives indicating hierarchies of each learning domain\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nEducation is a process that brings about expected changes in human behavior. Educational objective is defined as what the students should be able to do at the end of a learning period that they could not do beforehand. Mager defined educational objective as “an intent communicated by a statement describing a proposed change in a learner when he has successfully completed a learning experience”. Objectives may be general and specific. Learning objectives serve as guidelines for content, instruction and evaluation. There remains a SMART way of writing learning objectives. It should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and transferable. \r\nThe taxonomy of educational objectives is intended to provide for classification of the educational system. In 1956, Benjamin Bloom published taxonomy of learning objectives containing three major domains namely cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains. \r\nImportance of learning objectives:\r\nLearning objectives is the cornerstone in any educational program. These guide the whole process of teaching learning for the particular goal(s). If the general and specific objectives are not set from the beginning, it is impossible to plan the curriculum, its content, how these acts will be done and how will be assessed. So, without objectives no educational activity is set. It will be like that of sailing in the sea without the destination and a compass.\r\nAim is the overall direction like aim of undergraduate medical education (MBBS) is to make medical graduates able to serve community needs. The general objective of this program is to ensure some defined knowledge, skills and attitudes that students should attain throughout the course. The specific objectives are further details; suppose, to deal a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis they should be able to state symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, elicit relevant clinical findings (if present), plan for investigating the case, make a treatment plan and counsel the patient and caregiver(s)/family members regarding importance of treatment adherence, possible adverse effects of drugs, transmission of disease (tuberculosis) etc.\r\nImportance of taxonomy:\r\nTaxonomy of educational objectives serves different objectives:\r\n- Indicates the type of learning outcomes that should be considered\r\n- Provides a framework for classifying those outcomes\r\n- Directs attention towards changes in students’ performance in a variety of areas\r\n- Forms the blue print for the assessment tool\r\n- Provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs easier\r\nEvaluation of urinary tract infection (UTI) is planned with hierarchies of each learning domains\r\nCognitive domain:\r\nObjectives: Undergraduate medical students are expected to know following facts regarding UTI.\r\nEvaluation Why a patient with UTI is not responding to oral ciprofloxacin? \r\nThink about antibiotic resistance\r\nSynthesis\r\n Accumulation of facts e.g. clinical presentation, examination findings and lab. reports to make a diagnosis of UTI\r\nAnalysis Analysis \r\nApplication Ability to plan diagnostic tests in suspected UTI cases\r\nComprehension Ability to make a diagnosis of UTI from a given scenario \r\nRecall Define UTI\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychomotor domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to perform relevant clinical examination in a setting of UTI/pyelonephritis.\r\nOrganization  Student may show peers how to examine for renal angle tenderness\r\nAdaptation  Advanced learner may perform the act in a different situation like sitting position\r\nComplex overt response Students perform in presence of trainer\r\nMechanism  Trainer performs the act (identifies anatomical landmark first)\r\nGuided response  Trainer will describe first “how to examine for renal angle tenderness?”\r\nSet  Student stands on right side of examination couch\r\nPerception  Candidate is able to understand the instruction “examine for renal angle tenderness” in suspected UTI (pyelonephritis) \r\n\r\nAffective domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to counsel patient/family member(s) regarding UTI.\r\nCharacterization by value Internalize in candidate’s behavior for further cases\r\nOrganization  Have to be ready to offer effective help/empathy\r\nValuing  Will be ready to accept patients ideas/concerns\r\nResponding  Student/candidate will have to be ready to receive and answer question/quarries \r\nReceiving  Instruction: This 35-year-old diabetic patient is having recurrent UTI. Counsel her regarding the disease and consequences\r\n(Can recognize the situation when patients and care givers are waiting for information received from lab. reports)\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nEducational objectives are the core of an educational program. In any given topic of medical education, efforts should be given to organize objectives in different domains whenever possible for a better learning outcome.\r\n', '2018-01-28 18:03:34', 'upload/attachment/609595b11e502d1c92d15743233404d1.doc', '<p>Well written!</p><p>While writing learning objectives, it is important to select appropriate action verb</p><p>You did not write anything on the task- writing 5 learning capabilities that human can learn<br></p>', NULL, '2018-01-29 00:03:34', 'F'),

It should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and transferable. Learning objectives/education has 3 major areas or domain, which are interrelated. Domains are \r\n1. Cognitive domain/knowledge - included from the mere recall of facts or recognition of information through comprehension and understanding to an ability to solve problems. It also includes intellectual abilities and thinking skills\r\n2. Psychomotor domain or skill- includes the various perceptual and motor skills that are required of the efficient clinician.\r\n3. Affective domain or attitude-includes the personal qualities of the students like self-confidence, initiative, interests, appreciation, mode of adjustment and their attitude towards profession, their parents and their peers.\r\nEach domain again has some order or system of classification which has the advantage of being hierarchical in form i.e. achievement of higher objectives from lower order.so in educational objective skill develop from simple task to complex order.\r\n Evaluation of Glomerulonephritis (GN) is planned with hierarchies of each learning domains\r\nCognitive domain:\r\nObjectives: Undergraduate medical students are expected to know following facts regarding GN\r\n\r\nEvaluation Why a patient with GN not responding to oral steroids?\r\nThink about immune suppressive\r\nSynthesis\r\n Making a diagnosis from clinical presentation, examination findings and lab. reports\r\nAnalysis Analysis \r\nApplication Ability to plan diagnostic tests in suspected GN cases\r\nComprehension Ability to make a pathophysiology of GN  \r\nRecall Define GN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychomotor domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to perform renal biopsy\r\nOrganization  Student may show peers how to do renal biopsy\r\nAdaptation  Advanced learner doing renal biopsy  in a different situation like sitting position\r\nComplex overt response Students doing renal biopsy smoothly ,quickly and without hesitation\r\nMechanism  Trainer performs the biopsy with some confidence\r\nGuided response  Trainer gain knowledge by following the instructor how to do renal biopsy\r\nSet  Students are mentally prepare  for doing biopsy, positioning the patient in lying,  stands on right side of examination couch\r\nPerception  Candidate is able to understand the instruction  \r\n\r\n\r\nAffective domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to counsel patient/family member(s) regarding GN.\r\nCharacterization by value Internalize in candidate’s behavior for further cases\r\nOrganization  Have to be ready to offer effective help/empathy\r\nValuing  Will be ready to accept patients ideas/concerns\r\nResponding  Student/candidate will have to be ready to receive and answer question/quarries \r\nReceiving  Can recognize the situation when patients and care givers are waiting for information received from lab. reports\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nEducational objectives are the core of an educational program.

Write at least 5 specific objectives on any topic of your specialty according to the hierarchies in each learning domain', 'Assignment\r\nA helpful way to approach any challenge is to use a taxonomy as a guideline. A taxonomy is just a fancy term for the practice and science of classification. Taxonomies are developed to provide a framework for organizing a continuum along an underlying structure. \r\nTaxonomies of learning are the hierarchical classification in the field of education, have been developed by various groups concern with educational problems to help teachers to formulate precisely the educational objective. \r\nThe important taxonomies are Bloom''s Taxonomy, SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of Observed Learning Outcome) and McGuire preparation for achievement test. Educational psychologist consider three working levels of taxonomy to satisfy the need of evaluation\r\nIn 1956, Dr. Benjamin Bloom and several other educational psychologists published set of guidelines for developing educational objectives. Known as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this framework clarified the different stages of learning into three main domains: cognitive, psychomotor and affective.\r\nBloom’s taxonomy primarily provides instructors with a focus for developing their course learning objectives. It can be used to increase one''s understanding of the educational process. \r\nBloom''s taxonomy was developed to provide a common language for teachers to discuss and exchange learning and assessment methods. \r\n      Importance of taxonomy in educational program:\r\n1)  Taxonomy is a helpful tool in writing objectives and identifying how well the students comprehend a concept. \r\n2) It indicates the type of learning outcome that should be considered and it also provides a framework for classifying those outcomes.\r\n3) Specific learning objectives can be derived from the taxonomy, though it is most commonly used to assess learning on a variety of cognitive levels.\r\n4) It helps to determine the sequence of a segment of course to formulate instructional design and evaluation system.\r\n5) It also help educators focus on all three domains when teaching, thus creating a much more holistic form of education that can fit different learning styles and increase retention.\r\n6) It encourages higher-order thought in the students by building up from lower-level cognitive skills.\r\n7)  It also helps in Knowing the different levels and looking for where students fall among them  that will enable the fascilitators to move them from a basic level of understanding to a more complex level. \r\n8) This understanding facilitates the prioritizing of material and can steer the organization of lessons to maximize class time. For example, lower-level skills (e.g., memorizing factual knowledge) can be developed before higher-level skills are introduced (e.g., analysis of relationships).\r\n9) Beyond writing objectives, taxonomy is also extremely helpful in assessing students’ understanding of concepts.\r\n10) Taxonomy can be used as a checklist to ensure that all levels of a domain have been assessed and align assessment methods with the appropriate lessons and methodologies.\r\n11) It provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs.\r\nThe taxonomy guides all about in an educational program.\r\nIn this way, the taxonomy also makes it easier for instructors to maintain consistency between assessment methods, content and instructional materials and identify weak areas.\r\nLearning objectives are also called instructional objectives or performance objectives. They are the statements that describe what students will be able to do once they successfully complete a unit of instruction .\r\n Learning objectives are goals, not the activities performed to achieve those goals.\r\nA good learning objective is specific, measurable, and clearly stated. Learning objectives are a critical component of instruction. It describes the learner behavior It describes the behavior that can be seen or heard. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum.\r\n     Importance of learning objective educational program :\r\n1. It provides a guideline for content\r\n2. Helps in preparing a lesson plan\r\n3. Provide course developers guidance on selecting suitable: \r\no instructional materials;\r\no teaching methods, including learning activities and use of technology;\r\no assessment methods.\r\n4. Help students focus on what they are expected to learn, and understand how they will be assessed.\r\n5. It provides a guideline of evaluation\r\n6. A clearly stated learning objective can help an instructor create appropriate learning activities to help students acquire the desired skills and select good assessment tools to evaluate students'' achievement.\r\nThat’s why it is always emphasized that learning objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, transferable. Learning objectives target knowledge, skills or attitudes for change. Good learning objectives are consistent with the goals of the course and curriculum\r\n\r\nI am from Biochemistry specialty and my topic is “Clinical Biochemistry and Endocrinology”\r\nFrom cognitive domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Define bilirubin and state different types of serum bilirubin\r\n• Explain the mechanism of development of hyperbilirubinaemia\r\n• State the indication of measurement of serum bilirubin\r\n• Differentiate different types of jaundice from serum bilirubin level\r\n• State the other biomarkers to differentiate different types of jaundice\r\nFrom psychomotor domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Asses the subject whether he is ready for the procedure (estimation of serum bilirubin)\r\n• Collect specimen properly from the appropriate site without any complication\r\n• Perform the test properly by using appropriate reagent and instruments\r\n• Interpret the test results\r\nFrom Affective domain:\r\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to:\r\n• Attend the subject properly and listen his complains\r\n• State the subject about the importance of the test regarding his condition\r\n• Correlate the test result with the pathological condition\r\n• support the subject mentally\r\nEducational objectives are short, well structured statements that specifies what the learners are expected to achieve at the end of an educational program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-26 10:42:38', 'upload/attachment/429216770e554eb158c131e2a7482947.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

(66, 35, 'Assignment ', 'A. Importance of Learning Objectives in Educational Program\r\nI. Introduction\r\nIn educational program learning objectives are brief statements that describes what students will be expected to learn by the end of study year, course, unit lesson, project or class period. It is the cornerstone of instructional technology, precise and detail, relates to one aspect of area. All learners need to know what is expected of them – in other words they need to be informed of learning outcomes/objectives. Once the contents to be included in a lesson have been decided by need assessment, task analysis, curricular guides or other materials, the next step is to develop, write or select the objectives which will comprise of the unit of instructions. \r\nII. Importance\r\n“Remember that if you don’t know where you are going, you can’t know how to get there.” The statement stresses the importance of learning outcome. Selection of learning objectives are important in every aspect of teaching learning process. \r\n• Objectives contribute to instructional process in the following ways:\r\n It provides direction for the instructor and it clearly conveys his instructional intent to others. \r\n It provides a guide for selecting the subject matter, the teaching method and the materials to be used during instructions. \r\n It provides a guide for constructing test and other instruments for evaluating student achievement. \r\n• Learning objective tell students what is important: \r\nWithout learning objectives it is difficult for students to know what they are supposed to be learning. In a lecture, teacher can talk extensively about a case but unless he or she states explicitly, it can be difficult for students to know where to direct their attention. Do they need to know the details of that specific case or what principles are they supposed to glean from the example? Students can waste a great deal of time studying the things that are not necessary, to the detriment of their learning as a whole. The uncertainty also cause unnecessary anxiety.  \r\n• Learning objectives enable good assessment development:\r\nEach year as we write our assessments we should go through the learning objectives and make sure their assessed. In this way, the assessment becomes fair and applied to the course. \r\n• Learning objectives encourage reflection and good course design and development:\r\nDevelopment is an intrinsic part of medicine. Knowledge has grown rapidly over the last fifty years, new skill have become a routine part of practice and old skills have become redundant. As instructors write and review the learning objectives in a course, they can identify the level of learning that is specified in each. At an entry level course it is acceptable to have a number of lower level learning objectives. However, there needs to be some serious thinking done if a post-graduate course is not mainly made up of higher level learning objectives. The use of learning objectives linked with assessment design helps us to identify the background knowledge that we assume students have.  \r\n• Learning objectives promotes equity and reduces unnecessary stress:\r\nLearning objectives help reduce the ‘gaming’ aspects that can proliferate in the absence of clear information. \r\n\r\nIII. Conclusion\r\nThe derivation, development, organization and formulation of objectives are among the most difficult of the educational tasks a faculty must performed. Unless this work is done, the effort invested in teaching learning process represents long journey with neither compass nor map. \r\n\r\nB. Importance of Taxonomy in Educational Program\r\nI. Introduction\r\nTaxonomy is as old as the language skill of the mankind. Taxonomy is important because it allows us to represent the evolution of living organisms expose the differences and similarities between them. The taxonomy of educational objectives is intended to provide for classification of the goals of the educational system. Although the specific learning outcomes resulting from a course of study may run into hundreds, most of them can be classified under a small number of headings. One of the most important aim in post primary education is the attainment of critical or higher order thinking skills. Identifying how to encourage, teach and then assess their skills is important. Taxonomy of educational objectives is regarded as a tool for such.  \r\nII. Importance\r\n• Taxonomy is a language for communication, and essential infrastructure for other activities in society. Lack of good taxonomy and skilled taxonomists is an impediment for society. If a researcher does not have a reliable name on his/her study object, it is impossible to communicate and publish on the results.  If the taxonomy is poor studies may be conducted on different texa but reported by the same name create confusion. It is an essential infrastructure for other fields. \r\n• Taxonomy serves several useful purposes: \r\n Indicates the type of learning outcomes that should be considered.\r\n Provides a framework for classifying those outcomes. \r\n Directs attention towards changes in student performance in variety of areas \r\n Useful in designing a lesson plan and can be used to adopt a previously designed lesson\r\n Forms the blueprint for forming the assessment tools- taxonomy can help by providing lists of competencies available and in setting an appropriate level of performance.\r\n Asking questions at different taxonomic levels.\r\n Increasing the cognitive levels of activity.\r\n Provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching program easier. \r\n\r\nIII. Conclusion\r\nTo determine the standard to which the student will full-fill the learning outcome hierarchies of the taxonomy is important assessment tool. \r\n\r\nC. Specific Objectives on the Topic –“The Penis” According to the Hierarchies in Each Learning Domain\r\n\r\n1. Knowledge:\r\n• Define phimosis.\r\n• Explain the causes of UTI in phimosis.\r\n• Describe the steps of management of a boy with UTI for circumcision. \r\n• Choose the best technic for circumcision in phimosis.\r\n• Rationale the superiority of dissection method over guillotine method of circumcision.\r\n2. Skill: \r\n• Make a preoperative checklist for circumcision.\r\n• Position the boy on the operation table for circumcision.\r\n• Make a list of instruments for circumcision. \r\n• Enumerate the steps of circumcision.\r\n• Demonstrate the management of urethral injury during circumcision.  \r\n3. Attitude:\r\n• Put the points to be monitored in a boy after circumcision in the post-operative room\r\n• Identify the signs of a subcutaneous hematoma following circumcision.\r\n• Counsel the parents of a boy with reactionary hemorrhage following circumcision.\r\n• Not the immediate measures to control post-operative hemorrhage following circumcision.\r\n• Describes the measures to be taken to prevent recurrence of hemorrhage. \r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-01-28 01:21:57', 'upload/attachment/f0679b3f8cbea1d99f20e4c9327149ff.docx', '<p>Thanks for the answers for the task.

Objectives may be general and specific. Learning objectives serve as guidelines for content, instruction and evaluation. There remains a SMART way of writing learning objectives. It should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and transferable. \r\nThe taxonomy of educational objectives is intended to provide for classification of the educational system. In 1956, Benjamin Bloom published taxonomy of learning objectives containing three major domains namely cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains. \r\nImportance of learning objectives:\r\nLearning objectives is the cornerstone in any educational program. These guide the whole process of teaching learning for the particular goal(s). If the general and specific objectives are not set from the beginning, it is impossible to plan the curriculum, its content, how these acts will be done and how will be assessed. So, without objectives no educational activity is set. It will be like that of sailing in the sea without the destination and a compass.\r\nAim is the overall direction like aim of undergraduate medical education (MBBS) is to make medical graduates able to serve community needs. The general objective of this program is to ensure some defined knowledge, skills and attitudes that students should attain throughout the course. The specific objectives are further details; suppose, to deal a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis they should be able to state symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, elicit relevant clinical findings (if present), plan for investigating the case, make a treatment plan and counsel the patient and caregiver(s)/family members regarding importance of treatment adherence, possible adverse effects of drugs, transmission of disease (tuberculosis) etc.\r\n\r\nImportance of taxonomy:\r\nTaxonomy of educational objectives serves different objectives:\r\n- Indicates the type of learning outcomes that should be considered\r\n- Provides a framework for classifying those outcomes\r\n- Directs attention towards changes in students’ performance in a variety of areas\r\n- Forms the blue print for the assessment tool\r\n- Provides common grounds and makes comparison of various teaching programs easier\r\nEvaluation of urinary tract infection (UTI) is planned with hierarchies of each learning domains\r\nCognitive domain:\r\nObjectives: Undergraduate medical students are expected to know following facts regarding UTI\r\nEvaluation Assess and evaluate treatment response.\r\nSynthesis Now summarize the whole scenario.\r\nAnalysis Urine routine test revealed 15-20 pus cells per high power field (HPF) and 1-2 red blood cells/HPF. Urine culture revealed growth of Escherichia coli. Now analyze the report.\r\nApplication Mention two tests that you will request in this case and explain why?\r\nComprehension Interpret the scenario: A 30-year-old lady presented with dysuria, increased urinary frequency and fever. What is the most likely diagnosis?\r\nRecall Define UTI and name two common organisms responsible for UTI\r\n\r\nPsychomotor domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to perform relevant clinical examination in a setting of UTI/pyelonephritis\r\nInstruction: Examine for renal angle tenderness\r\nOrganization  Student may perform the act skillfully in front of peers how to examine for renal angle tenderness\r\nAdaptation  Advanced learner may perform the act in a different situation like sitting position\r\nComplex overt response Students perform in presence of trainer\r\nMechanism  Trainer performs the act (identifies anatomical landmark first)\r\nGuided response  Trainer will describe first “how to examine for renal angle tenderness?”\r\nSet  Student  walks to the right side of examination couch\r\nPerception  Candidate is able to understand the instruction “examine for renal angle tenderness” in suspected UTI (pyelonephritis) case\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAffective domain:\r\nObjectives: Students are expected to counsel patient/family member(s) regarding UTI\r\nInstruction: Counsel the patient and her family members regarding the diagnosis and prognosis\r\nCharacterization by value Revise the act and internalize in candidate’s behavior for further cases\r\nOrganization  Discuss in details and organize effective help/empathy\r\nValuing  Recognize and appreciate patient’s ideas/concerns\r\nResponding  Student/candidate will comply to receive and answer question/quarries \r\nReceiving  Student listens to the instruction: This 35-year-old diabetic patient is having recurrent UTI. Counsel her regarding the disease and consequences\r\n(Can recognize the situation when patients and care givers are waiting for information received from lab. reports)\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nEducational objectives are the core of an educational program. In any given topic of medical education, efforts should be given to organize objectives in different domains whenever possible for a better learning outcome.\r\n', '2018-01-30 09:41:06', 'upload/attachment/b48807bd7e6600cb5076904805481316.doc', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

(93, 63, 'Plan to improve educational environment and staff development program of Psychiatry Department BIRDEM & IMC', 'Learning environments are educational approaches, cultures, and physical settings for all types of learners and activities. Several of the key trends in educational models throughout the 20th and early 21st century include progressive education, constructivist education, and 21st century skills-based education. These can be provided in comprehensive or specialized schools in a variety of organizational models, including departmental, integrative, project-based, academy, small learning communities, and school-within-a-school. Each of these can also be paired, at least in part, with design-based, virtual school, flipped classroom, and blended learning models. We can apply these to our medical set up as well. We believe that the learning environment for medical education shapes the patient care environment. The highest quality of safe and effective care for patients and the highest quality of effective and appropriate education are rooted in human dignity. We embrace our responsibility to create, support, and facilitate the learning environment shared by our patients, learners, and teachers. In this environment, our patients witness, experience, and expect a pervasive sense of respect, collegiality, kindness, and cooperation among health care team members. This includes all professionals, administrators, staff, and beginning and advanced learners from all health professions. This includes research as well as patient care environments. We affirm our responsibility to create, support, and facilitate a learning environment that fosters resilience in all participants. It is our responsibility to create an atmosphere in which our learners and teachers are willing to engage with learning processes that can be inherently uncomfortable and challenging. We affirm our commitment to shaping a culture of teaching and learning that is rooted in respect for all. Fostering resilience, excellence, compassion, and integrity allows us to create patient care, research, and learning environments that are built upon constructive collaboration, mutual respect, and human dignity \r\nIn Bangladesh mental health expenditures from government health department are very insignificant and are less than 0.5%. In terms of affordability of mental health services less than 0.11% of the population has free access to essential psychotropic medication. The total number of human resources working in mental health facilities or private practice per 100,000 populations is 0.49 as stated in WHO-AIMS, 2005 report.  We have Stigma in the society, less awareness about mental health and inadequate manpower. However we have to try and overcome this adverse situation & we can only do it by improving the educational environment and proper staff development.\r\nTeachers, in their role in the learning environment, must teach to support and actively incorporate elements of motivation. We must ensure that when using innovative and fun teaching strategies, we embed elements that motivate our learners to do better. \r\nPlan to Improve Educational Environment and staff development program for the Department of Psychiatry, BIRDEM & IMC-\r\nLearning depends on several factors, but a crucial step is the engagement of the learner. This is affected by their motivation and perception of relevance. These, in turn, can be affected by learners'' previous experiences and preferred learning styles and by the context and environment in which the learning is taking place. In adult learning theories, teaching is as much about setting the context or climate for learning as it is about imparting knowledge or sharing expertise.  \r\nRegarding learning environment of my specialty I want to arrange role play and visit in community and tertiary care hospital which will motivate them for learning psychiatry by reducing stigma and negative attitude. I want to provide online self-assessment questioners for my students which will also motivate their learning. With the help of organization a Virtual learning environment can be created including online tools, databases and managed resources. Students can watch videos of rare and difficult cases which are not commonly presented in our Institute. Teaching and supporting staff is not sufficient for our specialty at present. We need to recruit more teachers and supporting staff for better service to our students.\r\nRegarding Staff development of our specialty teaching improvement is an important aspect. As our department lacks a good number of teachers we should implement self-directed learning by self-reflection & evaluation by students. Videotaping and supportive critiquing through online service from other departments or peer institute can be effective. We can involve students in different community level study through which our skills in conducting scientific study will improve as well. As we know “To teach is to learn twice” principle should be the main motivating factors for staff development.  Staff development programmes should base themselves on the needs of the individuals as well as the institution. Student needs, patient needs and societal needs may help to direct relevant activities. Assessing need is necessary to refine goals, determine content, identify preferred learning formats and assure relevance. So application of written questionnaires or surveys, interviews or focus group with key informants, observation of teachers’ in action’ & literature review  is a must for proper planning to be started for staff development in our institute.\r\n\r\nReferences-\r\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_environment\r\n2.

Survey tools, such as the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM), have been developed to enable ‘global readings and diagnostic analyses of undergraduate environments in medical schools and other health professions institutes’ \r\nDoes environment matter?\r\n If evidence of the effectiveness of a positive environment on learner outcomes is limited, the negative effects of an adverse climate seem to be well recognized. AMA, for example, refers to supervisors’ lack of professionalism during interactions with patients and trainees, pressure on learners to behave in ways they may perceive as unprofessional and the presence of harassment or bullying\r\nOn the other hand, the General medical council (GMC) 2011 State of Medical Education and Practice (SOMEP) report points to the effects of a positive environment. It notes research which ‘suggests that medical students and trainees gain from practical experience and positive role models’\r\nConclusion: So, improvement of these three environmental factors for the learning environment to the exclusion of other environmental considerations. Aside from population forecasts, community needs and relationship continue, for the most part to be ignored. The physical environment has been left to the architect and consulting engineers. Many building design solutions solved physical facility needs. Student representation on curriculum committees is one means of ensuring a more student centered course. Students who are having difficulties need to be identified early and given additional support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Staff development program\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n Staff development/faculty development becomes an increasingly important component of medical education. Staff development activities have been designed to improve teacher effectiveness at all levels of educational continuum (e.g. undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education) and diverse programmes have been offered to healthcare professionals in many settings. Bland et al 1990 defined staff development is a planned programme designed to prepare institutions and faculty members for their various roles\r\nObjective:\r\n1. There should be clearly defined the goals and priorities\r\n2. Target audience\r\n3. Choice of program, content and methodology\r\n\r\n  Faculty development functions include\r\n• Teaching skill\r\n• Understand the institutional/ organizational culture\r\n• Determine appropriate goals and priorities\r\n• Mentoring program\r\n•   Conduct needs assessments to ensure relevant programming\r\n• Develop different programs to accommodate diverse needs\r\n• Incorporate principles of adult learning and instructional design\r\n• Offer a diversity of educational methods\r\n• Prepare staff developers\r\n• Evaluate and demonstrate effectiveness \r\nOthers are\r\n• Decentralized activities\r\n• Peer coaching\r\n• Self-directed learning\r\n• Computer aided instruction\r\nEffective faculty development program: Effective programs focus on the participants, teachers, the program instructors, instructional methods and characteristics of the participants teaching setting\r\nEffective faculty development programs have the following characteristics\r\n• Address the needs of the faculty participants and institution\r\n• Takes into account the work palace of the teachers\r\n• Integrate curriculum that emphasizes theory and practice\r\n• Opportunity for practice and feedback\r\n• Build relationship among faculty members\r\n• Train more them one person from a setting\r\n\r\nBrief discussion of few methods\r\n\r\nTeaching skill: Teaching skill is key content of staff development programme. The aim is to improve teacher’s skill in clinical teaching, small group facilitation, lecturing, feedback and evaluation. Staff development has an important role to play in promoting teaching as a scholarly activity and in creating an educational leadership, innovation and excellence. \r\nUnderstand the institutional/ organizational culture: Staff development programmes take place within the context of a specific institution or organization. It is imperative to understand the culture of that institution and to be responsive to its needs. Staff development programmes should capitalize on the organization’s strength and work with the leadership to ensure success\r\nIncorporate principles of adult learning and instructional design: Adult come to learning situations with a variety of motivations and expectations about teaching methods and goals. Key principles of adult learning include the following\r\n• Adult are independent\r\n• Adult come to learning situations with a variety of motivations and definite   expectations about particular learning goals and teaching methods\r\n• Adult demonstrate different learning styles\r\n• Much of the adult learning is relearning rather than new learning\r\n• Adult learning often involves changes in attitudes as well as skills\r\n• Most adult prefer to learn through experience\r\n• Incentives for adult learning usually come from within the individual\r\n• Feedback is usually more important than tests and evaluations\r\n\r\nConclusion: Staff developers should be individuals who are well respected by their peers and have some educational expertise and experience in facilitating groups. “To teach is to learn twice “principle should be the main motivating factors for staff developer. To motivate faculty, we need to develop a culture that promote and encourage professional development, consider multiple approaches to achieving the same goal, tailor program to meet individual and organizational needs. Building a network of interested persons is integral to the faculty development program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-02-01 17:54:43', 'upload/attachment/0615792d466f532abf09379cf2158aec.docx', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

An enriched learning environment can lead to increased satisfaction, achievement and success as a practitioner. The educational environment has been defined as “environment experienced or perceived by the students as well as by the teachers”. \r\nThese perceptions would be based on three important aspects which include: the physical environment, emotional climate, and intellectual climate. As educational institutes continue to become more student oriented, students’ perceptions of higher educational facilities and services are becoming increasingly important. \r\nI can improve educational environment of my own department in following ways:\r\n1) By assessing and providing proper physical environment like – \r\n• the size of the room\r\n• Temperature of the room\r\n• Avoid distraction (noise, visual distraction)\r\n• Adequate sitting arrangement\r\n•  Adequate audiovisual equipments\r\n                                                                 \r\n2) By providing well equiped laboratory with adequate tools, instruments and reagents\r\n3) By maintaining number of teachers with required qualifications and teacher student ratio\r\n4) By maintaining good student teacher relationship\r\n5) By providing with appealing salaries;and a safe, secure, and comfortable facility to high caliber educators; and by  providing even basic needs for students, such as adequate nutrition, health care, adequate rest, and support at dormitory for homework \r\n6) By planning an academic calender according to course curriculum \r\n7) By discussing with the faculty members about the teaching learning methods to make the curriculum easy by encouraging small group teaching, PBL, \r\n8) By arranging Departmental seminar with the involvement of students and teachers\r\n9) Providing assignment to the students under the guidance of teachers \r\n10) By ensuring good source of informations by developing enriched libraries along with computer and internet facilities\r\n11) By developing virtual learning environment (or VLE) which is increasingly common in higher education and also in medical education. VLE can provide course information such as study guides, forms, workbooks, time tables of exam, academic calendars of schedule events both for students and staffs. Blending of traditional learning and VLE can improve the educational environment.\r\n12) By developing teaching and technical staff of the department\r\n13) As learning environment affects student’s motivation and achievement, it is important to get feedback from the students on how they feel about their learning environment. Students’ perception of the educational environment is a useful basis for modifying and improving its quality. \r\n14) By assessing teacher’s perception about the educational environment is also very important for improvement\r\nTo measure medical and health education environment, the Dundee Ready Education, Environment Measure (DREEM) was developed. \r\n\r\nStaff development or faculty development has become an increasingly essential component in medical education. \r\nStaff development can be viewed as the activities and programs that help staff members learn about their responsibilities, develop required skills and competencies necessary to accomplish institutional and national goals and purposes and grow personally and professionally to prepare themselves for the advancement in the institution or beyond the campus.\r\nStaff development  program take place within the context of a specific institution  and department. It is important to clearly define goals and priorities of the department and according to this we can develop our staffs. \r\nI can improve staff development program of my own department in following ways:\r\n1) Workshop: We can arrange workshops on specific topics like MCQs, SAQs or OSPEs 6 monthly for our teachers by the experts on medical education and  can also send them to other institute like CME for  workshop and can encourage them to share their new achievements.\r\n2)  Short courses: we should always up to date about the short courses that are beneficiary to our teaching staffs according to their educational qualifications and should inform them and encourage them about the courses.\r\n3) Seminars: We can allow our teaching staffs to organize seminars on a specific topic at the the end of each month in the presence of Head of the Department and other seniors and experts who can give them positive feedback.\r\n4) Consultation with professional educators: With the help of an expert of medical education we can guide our teaching staff to make their lesson plan accurately\r\n5) Integrated longitudinal programes: By this program, faculty members allocate 10- 20% of their working hours for improving their educational knowledge and skills by maintaining other activities\r\n6) Peer coaching: It is also called co-teaching. It enables individualized learning and foster collaboration. It also allows health care professionals to learn about each others as they teach togather\r\n7) Mentorship: It is a valuable but underutilized staff development strategy. It promotes the socialization, development and maturation of academic faculty.\r\n8) Self directed learning: It promotes reflection -in -action and reflection- on- action. Teachers should be encouraged to determine their own needs through self reflection, evaluation by students, peer feedback and they should learn to design their own developmental activities. \r\n9) Computer aided instruction: This is closely tied to self-directed learning initiatives. Web based learning can allow for individualized programs targeted to specific needs and the sharing of resources.\r\n10) Performance reward: Staffs can be rewarded for their performances which can motivate them for self development\r\n11) Staff developers should be well trained, experienced and creative.\r\nAs job descriptions, individual goals and even the mission of institution or department may change so staff development plans will be reviewed on a regular basis. Changes to staff development plan shall be made as needed. Both the supervisor and the staff members must agree upon changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-02-06 05:12:30', 'upload/attachment/4ddcaba71e8043e2af7fc8493d6d24a1.doc', '<p>Tanks for your effort.

(96, 69, 'Write a plan to improve educational environment & how to improve staff development program of your own department.', 'Dr. Md. Towhidur Rahman         ID- GD2GOB\r\nName of the assignment – Write a plan to improve educational environment & how to improve staff development program of your own department.\r\nPlan to improve educational environment in my department (Radiology & Imaging) :\r\nLearning environment is an educational approach, cultural context, or physical setting in which teaching & learning occur. An improved learning environment is very important for achieving a successful educational outcome. We take a policy to develop our own strategy so that every faculty member can get a scope to develop their own carrier.\r\nOperational characteristics: \r\nThe operation of the educational facility can have a determining role of the nature of the learning environment. Before improvement of educational environment of the department operational characteristics of my department should be known which includes-\r\n• Organization type: Private.\r\n• Structure: Less structured\r\n• Schedule: Academic year (July session in every year), class periods (8am to 12 pm)\r\n• Staffing: Number of teachers – 10, other staff – 60.\r\n• Attendance: Student attendance.\r\n• Teacher certification: Post graduate degree-MD, M phil, FCPS\r\n• Assessment: Testing and standards provided by academy.\r\n• Partnerships and mentoring: Relationships between the learning environments and outside entities or individuals in general study.\r\n• Organizational model: Departmental.\r\n• Curriculum: The subjects comprising a course of study.\r\n\r\nA learning culture is a collection of organizational conventions, values, practices and processes. These conventions encourage employees and organizations develop knowledge and competence. Culture affects the behavior of educators, students, staff & community.\r\n\r\nTo create a learning culture into my department following key steps are as follows-\r\n• Formalize training and development plans- For a learning culture to be ingrained, it should be mandatory for all individuals in the department. Example – Hazards of radiation.\r\n• Give recognition to learning-  Employees who have successfully learned new skills and abilities should be recognized and encourage others to follow suit.\r\n• Get feedback-  Sessions and polls should regularly be done to evaluate the benefits of training and development, as well as to determine whether the training investment is well spent.\r\n• Promote from within- One of the advantages of training is having employees who are ready for a bigger role. Announce an internal job posting to encourage employees to gain knowledge.\r\n• Develop knowledge and information sharing into a formal process- People will be more encouraged to share knowledge and information if they are required to do so. Formalizing the process makes sure that everyone who needs the information gets it.\r\n\r\nLearning styles may be included – \r\n*Active learning - Active learning is a model of instruction that focuses the responsibility of learning on learners, not on teacher-led instruction, a model also termed student-centered. It is based on the premise that in order to learn, students must do more than just listen: they must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems.\r\n*Passive learning- Passive learning, a key feature of direct instruction, has at its core the dissemination of nearly all information and knowledge from a single source, the teacher with a textbook providing lessons in lecture-style format.\r\n* Hands on learning – Active & experiential learning, predates language & the ability to convey knowledge by means other than demonstration.\r\n* Differentiated learning - Direct instruction is expanding to include students conducting independent or guided research with multiple sources of information, greater in-class discussion, group collaboration, experiential (hands-on, project-based, etc).\r\n* Progressive education - Includes qualities such as learning by doing (hands-on projects, experiential learning, integrated curriculum, problem solving, critical thinking, group work, social skills development).\r\n* Constructivist education- It is a movement includes active learning, discovery learning, and knowledge building, and all versions promote a student''s free exploration within a given framework or structure. The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working answering open-ended questions.\r\n* Traditional learning – To increase resources of libraries, proper space & ventilation and adequate seatings in teaching rooms, adequate instruments in lab etc.\r\n* e-learning – Providing learning & teaching resources such as searchable study guides & lecture materials, computed aided learning materials, discussion boards (both for general communication & for mediating online teaching & learning) & assessment. Large amounts of the users participation can be carried out online, being accessible –\r\n- From anywhere in the world.\r\n- At any time\r\n- At the convenience of the individual user. \r\n\r\nEffective learning environment can be achieved by – \r\n1. The students ask the questions.\r\n2. Questions are valued over answers.\r\n3. Ideas come from a divergent sources.\r\n4. A variety of learning models may be used – Inquiry based learning, project based learning, direct instruction, peer-to-peer learning, e-learning, mobile learning.\r\n5. Classroom learning empties into a connected community.\r\n6. Learning is personalized by a variety of criteria.\r\n7. Assessment is persistent, authentic, transparent & never punitive.\r\n8. Criteria for success is balanced & transparent.\r\n9. Learning habits are constantly modeled.\r\n10. There are constant opportunities for practice.\r\n\r\nHow to improve staff development program in my department (Radiology& Imaging)\r\nStaff development or faculty development has become an increasingly essential component in medical education. Staff development is a planned program designed to prepare institutions & faculty members for their various role. Now a days, virtual learning  gets a momentum to develop the environment of the institute.\r\nTarget population –\r\n1. Medical teachers\r\n2. Course coordinator / curriculum planners\r\n3. Administrator\r\n4. Organizer\r\n5. Healthcare professional\r\nApproaches-\r\nTeacher can take advantages of several types of format. Such as- \r\na. Workshops- One of the most popular formats because of their inherent flexibility & promotion of active learning.\r\nb. Seminars\r\nc. Short courses\r\nd. Consultation with professional educators\r\ne. By motivating  e-learning\r\nf. Traditional – Using libraries, study guides, lectures.\r\nFaculty members can use a variety of teaching methods within this format, including-\r\na. Interactive lectures\r\nb. Small group discussion & exercise.\r\nBased on changing needs & priorities, alternative formats are also be considered that include-\r\n1. Self directed learning\r\n2. Microteaching\r\n3. Peer coaching\r\n4. Mentoring\r\n5. Feedback from learners\r\n6. Videotape review\r\n7. Self evaluation\r\n8. Computer aided instruction.\r\n\r\n• Integrated longitudinal programme- In this programme, faculty members allocate 10-20% of their working hours for improving their educational knowledge & skills while maintaining the other activities.\r\n• Peer coaching – Key element of peer coaching includes the identification of individual learning  goals (improving specific teaching skills), focused observation of teaching by colleague & the provision of feedback, analysis & support.\r\n• Mentoring – A mentor is someone who has done helping someone who is just starting to do. Mentoring is almost always defined as a senior, more experienced person, guiding  a junior, less experienced one in preparing instructional method & lecture, delivering information.\r\n• e-learning –\r\n*Computer aided instruction – It is closely tied to self directed learning initiatives. This web based learning  allow for individualized programs targeted to specific needs & the sharing of resources.\r\n*Virtual learning environment (VLE) – is an integrated set of online tools, databases & managed resources that exist as a coherent system, functioning collectively in support of education. The goal is to provide students & staff with a range of online services & resources which will enhance the quality of student learning experience & improve the effectiveness & efficiency of teaching & learning. Providing learning & teaching resources such as searchable study guides & lecture materials, computed aided learning materials, discussion boards (both for general communication & for mediating online teaching & learning) & assessment. Large amounts of the users participation can be carried out online, being accessible –\r\n- From anywhere in the world.\r\n- At any time\r\n- At the convenience of the individual user. \r\n*Self directed learning – Teacher should be encouraged to determine their own needs through self reflection, evaluation by students & peer feedback.\r\n• Training of faculty in effective large group presentation- The variety of options for training faculty members in effective large group teaching includes courses & workshops, peer coaching, mentoring & consultations.\r\nDesigning a staff development programme- \r\n1. Understand the institutional culture.\r\n2. Determine appropriate goals & priorities.\r\n3. Conduct needs assessment to ensure relevant programing.\r\n4. Develop different programs  to accommodate diverse needs.\r\n5. Incorporate principles of adult learning & instructional design.\r\n', '2018-02-06 08:12:39', 'upload/attachment/84bed18a73e5daf56410be56f1dfe968.docx', '<p xss=removed><span xss=removed>Thanks\r\nfor preparing assignment.   some observation regarding your assignments are as bellow:<o></o></span></p><p xss=removed><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Strategies</font><span xss=removed>  regarding staff development program: you should have write on your strategy.<o></o></span></p><ol><li xss=removed><span xss=removed>your\r\ndepartment should have have the strategies like <b><u>selection of target population</u>, Adopting  the approaches,</b> assessment of\r\nneed, selection of key content are, Arrangement of appropriate method.<o></o></span></li><li xss=removed><span xss=removed>The\r\nfaculty also have some strategies and plan.<o></o></span></li></ol><p xss=removed><span xss=removed>In\r\neducational environment: Rewrite this portion according to  the s</span><span xss=removed>trategies\r\nfor <b>physical setting</b> (classroom climate) and <b>context</b>, Institutional <b>culture,</b>vision &\r\nmission, and  and <b>educational approac</b>h should be mentioned</span></p><p xss=removed><span xss=removed>Pl\r\nrewrite and submit today.<o></o></span></p><p xss=removed><span xss=removed>thanks <o></o></span></p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p xss=removed><span xss=removed>Prof\r\nMd Shah Alam<o></o></span></p>', NULL, '2018-02-06 14:12:39', 'F'),

This scenario is not compatible with modern era. Life\r\nhas become complicated in many aspects. Today’s \r\nmentorship & belonging \r\ntheme  of learning module\r\nrepresent some aspects of this old system.  Assessment was mostly  formative \r\n& unidirectional  at that time\r\nas only the GURU had power to give exit  \r\naward to the SISHYA or learner.

Other factors that\r\nare to be considered in adult staff development programme  are motivation, expectation, experience  of learners may not go with a prefixed seat\r\nprogramme.

In its broadest sense, e-learning is the use of the internet for education. E-learning, often referred to as online learning encompasses a pedagogical approach that typically aspires to be flexible, engaging and learner centered; one that encourages interaction, and collaboration and communication, often asynchronously.\r\n A classroom setting and an online learning environment can be compared; both can serve the purpose of learning in particular way.

Research, participate in discussions (reading, responding and post to discussion area or chat room), collaboration with other students, asking questions (e-mail and/or post question in discussion area), submit assignments (via e-mail or the discussion topic with or without attachments), complete quizzes and exams, network / socialize with classmates all these are possible not only in traditional class but also in e-learning environment. The exciting thing about the online environment is that you can still do many of the usual ‘classroom’ activities - and at a place that is convenient for you. \r\nAttending class in online learning environment is primarily an asynchronous environment – that is, we don''t have to log on to the computer at exactly the same time as our instructor or classmates in order to attend class. We will however, have specific deadlines to meet for the reading assignments and learning activities. \r\nCourse content is provided within the online course. We have the option of reading this information while online, or printing the information and reading it later. Additional information may also be provided in the form of links to other valuable web sites, articles or textbook. Just as in a face-to-face classroom setting, our comprehension of information will be assessed. Assessment may be accomplished through the use of discussion questions, self-tests, case studies, role plays, etc.\r\nIn a classroom setting, the instructor may often pose a question. In many cases, the question leads to a serious discussion and/or debate with other students. This occurs in the online classroom through the use of discussion topics in the discussion area. One of the best features of an online discussion is that we don''t have to be present at exactly the same time in order to communicate with other members of this course. The online discussion environment uses topics and threads to organize conversations. A linked series of comments is called a discussion thread and each topic can contain several threads. \r\nOnline learning gives us an opportunity to share our discoveries with others, and learn from them. There will be times when we may need to work in small groups. Each member of the group will research and read specific information and share this with the other group members. Discussion topics are one way to collaborate online. We can also use e-mail to collaborate. Online courses have their own email package built right in so that only the students enrolled in the course can send and receive an e-mail message. Role plays and case studies may be used in online courses in order to provide us with real-life problems. Often, the discussion forum will be used to enable us solve these problems individually and with other classmates. \r\nThe instructor usually knows when we are confused or frustrated simply by our body language. In the online environment, the instructor cannot see this type of body language. This means that we must communicate when we don''t understand! We can use the email within the course to send questions to our instructor or post our question in the discussion area for all to see. We can also ask other classmates questions just as we would in a classroom setting. Our classmates come with a wealth of knowledge from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. Use the discussion topic to post a question for all to see or send a private email to a specific individual. Either way, communication is key. \r\nIn a classroom setting, classmates typically meet before or after class for a cup of coffee and a bit of socializing. This can still occur in the online environment using e-mail, the discussion area or chat rooms. Everyone likes know a bit about the people they are studying with. One of our first activities may be to post a profile. Sharing personal profiles makes the class more enjoyable and enables us to feel more connected while learning at a distance. So all these discussion leads to the conclusion that “Online environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment”  \r\n\r\n E-learning For Continuing Professional Development.\r\nProfessionals in hundreds of fields must meet continuing education requirements to stay current in their fields and to maintain their professional licenses or certifications.  E-Learning is a great fit for continuing education because busy working professionals can fit it into their schedules more easily than traditional classroom courses. \r\nDesigning effective eLearning for continuing education is not so different from designing effective eLearning for anyone else. We should focus on some points though. First, give the learners a heads up on the system and technical support before asking them to log in. Second, make sure their organizations can give them the time and resources they need to learn. Third, keep the interfaces as simple as possible so learners can focus on the content. Fourth, balance theoretical and practical materials. Fifth, include a traditional end-of-course test when possible. And finally, give them an opportunity to connect with other professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. https://www.bcit.ca/files/distance/pdf/bcitonlinelearning.pdf \r\n2. https://elearningindustry.com/continuing-professional-development-elearning-6-best-practices\r\n3.

(116, 86, 'Title: Online environment is merely an extension of face-to-face learning environment - why? Describe the process of e-learning and its role in continuing professional development', 'Introduction:\r\n In just few years, electronic (e) learning has become part of the mainstream in medical education. While e-learning means many things to many people, at its heart it is about the educational uses of technology. Educational technologies can be used in support of virtually any aspect of medical education. E- Learning, e- teaching and e- assessment are related but distinct areas of activity. Integrated e- learning systems in the form of virtual learning environment (VLE) or learning management systems are now the norm.\r\nE-learning: In its broadest sense, e-learning is the use of internet for education. e-learning, often referred as online learning, is not simply a broadcast of documents in electronic format to students via internet rather e-learning encompasses a pedagogical approach that typically aspires to be flexible, engaging and learner-centered, one that encourages interaction (staff-staff, staff-student and student-student) and collaboration and communication, often asynchronously (though not exclusively so). \r\ne-learning: content and process\r\nThe ‘process vs. content’ assumes a particular meaning and significance in e-learning, whether the predominant focus should be on digital content or on the digitally mediated process. If an online course or programme is primarily about participating in activity, then the focus is more likely to be on scheduling, discussion and tracking activity, with content management being a relatively small part of system. Virtual learning environment (VLE) can be used for the purpose.\r\nThe content of online learning is not exhaustive. Course materials are perhaps the most common content considered in e-learning. Also included contents are e-library, commercial e-learning contents and uncountable online websites. \r\nSystems: LMS, VLE and MLE\r\nThe most common approach in e-learning or online learning is to use an integrated suite of tools and services typically called learning management system &#40;LMS&#41;, course management system &#40;CMS&#41; or VLE\r\nVLE functions and services\r\nThe common functions, tools and services of VLE are as follows, but all of them may not be suitable for a single course-\r\n Supporting resources such as syllabus or course outline\r\n Links to additional learning contents\r\n Key words for guiding e-learners to search online learning materials\r\n Discussion boards (forums)\r\n Chat rooms for synchronous communication\r\n Blogs\r\n Online examinations and tests (quiz)\r\n Portfolio tools\r\n Other online tools/resources\r\n Scheduling (calendaring/timetabling) etc.\r\n \r\nFacilitating online learning\r\nSynchronous and asynchronous text interaction\r\nOnline facilitation typically uses bulletin boards or chat rooms as the point of contact between students and facilitators. Many of the principles of face-to-face teaching and learning also apply here. In synchronous formal question and answer session, students and staff on line are actually in a scenario of lecture theatre. All participate in common issue, usually first raised by the facilitator. Informal asynchronous activities like queries around specific course content are also important component.\r\nAudio conferencing, video conferencing and web conferencing\r\nMultimedia alternatives are growing rapidly and increasingly being used in on line learning as important and growing educational media examples are video conferencing, web conferencing and audio conferencing.\r\nFace-to-face learning vs. online learning\r\nFace-to-face learning is the oldest, most conventional and traditional method used for teaching learning activity. It allows learners to interact with lecturer and peers, exchange views and ideas. It requires commonness in time, place and interest (as applicable) of the course, learners, facilitators and supporting staff, requires administrative and logistic supports, human and monitory resources. Barrier of traditional methods include family commitment, inability to get locum coverage, distance to travel, cost of attending courses and increased workload. On the other hand, on line environment, if up to the mark, can provide almost all components of face-to-face learning. It saves time. Video and web conferencing are almost face-to-face interaction among learners and teachers and are able to remove limitations of other on line techniques. Important is that, the learners and teachers are to have some computer literacy, have to have own computer, on line access, administrators are to provide and update information etc. The security of the whole matter is also important.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nEvery method in teaching learning activity has its inherent merits and demerits. One is not better than other in all perspectives; rather one should be complimentary to the other. So, on line teaching environment should be regarded as extension of face-to-face learning environment.\r\ne-learning and its role in continuing professional development\r\nDefinition of continuing professional development\r\nContinuing professional development (CPD) is the systematic maintenance, improvement and broadening of knowledge and the development of personal qualities necessary for the education of professionals throughout the working life. CPD is a broader concept including essential reference to the personal and social aspects of medical practice needed for high quality professional performance in modern health care delivery system.\r\nImportance of CPD\r\nCPD in medical education is simply required for good medical practice. CPD is important for its relevance in professional success, because-\r\n It helps in improving competence (skills and knowledge)\r\n To maintain up to date standard \r\n Maintain quality of care\r\n\r\nMethods for CPD\r\n Formal: conference, workshop, lectures, etc.\r\n Informal: short-term placements, etc.\r\n\r\nFollowing types of learning are now recognized as part of CPD\r\n Distance and open learning\r\n Computer based learning\r\n Computer assisted learning\r\n Problem oriented learning including self-management learning\r\n Structured learning including articles\r\n Writing technical reports\r\n Part time teaching\r\n Membership of relevant professional committee\r\n Skill development\r\n Short-term placements\r\n\r\ne-learning and CPD\r\nIt is obvious that for maintaining the standards of medical care, physicians are to be up to date in knowledge and skills. Aside from the formal CPD, practitioners are to be familiar with the current development in global scenario. Without using e-learning it is impossible to remain up to date. So, like formal CPD, on line or use of e-learning in CPD is important.\r\nConclusion\r\nCPD is an indispensible part of a professional and e-learning is probably the most important learning method in CPD.\r\n', '2018-02-09 08:07:56', 'upload/attachment/2d2c0a0ab1a83ad7a38c0b3b41ea14c6.docx', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

(118, 60, 'Plan to Improve Educational Environment and Staff Development Program in Our Department', 'I. Introduction:\r\nEducational environment or climate is a key aspect of the curriculum. It is less tangible than the content studied, teaching methods used or the examinations. It is nonetheless of equal importance. To achieve the aim of the curriculum students’ perception about educational environment is very important. Educational environment is also invaluable to develop in students a spirit of team work and collaboration. Our institute and medical college have many of the facilities, still there are lacking and scope of improvement. \r\nII. Scope of Improvement and Suggestions:\r\ni. Course/curriculum- the new curriculum 2012 that is effective now is theoretically excellent, according to the objectives and to equip students with knowledge, skill and attitude, professionalism and critical thinking, though there are problems with its implementation. \r\nii. Appropriate aims - aims are set, thought difficult to achieve with traditional institutional set-up. It will be wise to add guidelines, indicating facilities and changes needed for institution to achieve such aims. \r\niii. Organized- as traditional curriculum with basic sciences first and applied science with clinical medicine next. It will be better to start integrated teaching from the very beginning of the M.B.B.S. course.\r\niv. Contents- within the curriculum is also appropriate, but overburdened with topics regarding theory. There are appropriate practical topics as well, again needs guideline and suggestion for changes in the institutions to achieve and implement such contents (discussed below).\r\nv. Assessment system- are also very modern, but lacks diversity in questioning and feedback system due to lack of faculty training. \r\n\r\nIII. Teaching Method: \r\nTeaching methods suggested in the curriculum are very good. To practice these methods appropriately faculty training and continuing professional development are necessary.  \r\nIV. Teachers:\r\nMost of our teachers are enthusiastic and interested in quality teaching. Many of them have short, comprehensive (3days) training on medical education either in government institute or in Ibrahim Medical College (on self-payment), but none has precise training. All teachers in the department must be trained at a wider extent with medical education, contents of the curriculum and technics for their implementation and practice. A training can be started with senior teachers followed by juniors. There should have orientation program for new faculties. \r\nTeachers need to sit with students at the beginning of each compartment of clinical placement to orient them about the contents to be completed during that period what is expected of them at the end, and assessment method. \r\nV. Physical Environment:\r\ni. Library- \r\n• Our library needs expansion and modification in sitting arrangement with scope for individuals as well as group discussions.\r\n• Number of books need to be increased consisting of basic to advanced so that those who wish to build up career in surgery can be benefited since student-hood. \r\n• Electronic library- we need an electronic library with internet and its attendant resource facilities. CD and DVD on clinical examination, skill practice and different surgical procedures (basic to advanced) should be available. High quality images and sound clips are also important.\r\n• Copies of curriculum, academic calendar, time-table, study guide must be available in the library. \r\nii. Study guides- need to be made available for students mentioning objectives, contents and organization, teaching method, resources available, revision, glossary, illustrations and assessment method. \r\niii. Lectures- present practice is traditional and one-way (didactic method). We need to change/shift to interactive lecture. Students should be informed of the topic, aims and objectives, time allowed for self-study, interactive class, feedback (student to teacher, teacher to student)\r\niv. Tutorials- number of rooms need to increased and made free of distractions:\r\n• Small group- to ensure student participation and interaction, group work and reflection.\r\n• Need to be equipped with computers and audio-visual aids to facilitate teaching-learning and instant inter-active feedback.\r\nv. Clinical skill center- need to be established to avoid exclusive dependence on adhoc experience and hospital patients, equipped with models and manikins, simulated clinical environment, simulated and standardized patients (due to paucity of patients), necessary instruments. It will ensure one on one revision session and remedial training of students. \r\nvi. Procedure room- with facility of patients’ comfort and logistics, space and observation system for each student. \r\nvii. Operation theatre- traditional system of theatre placement of students has many limitations (contamination of OT environment, distractions during surgery, poor observation facilities for students). Modern facilities and space should be made available so that each student can equally observe the procedure and interact with the faculty. \r\nviii. Bedside teaching- To ensure distraction-free environment exclusive side rooms for pre/post round discussions as attendant control is almost impossible in our set-up. Presence of a nurse/student nurse during teaching to add multi-professional inputs.\r\nix. Patients- need to be briefed earlier so that they know what will be expected to them, feel a part of discussion and give feedback to students.\r\nx. Grand rounds, teaching ward round- to be started. \r\nxi. Ambulatory care teaching-need to be made more effective, extended to beyond need of examinations. \r\nxii. Log books- need to be made more effective through daily fill-up and signed by tutor. \r\nxiii. Community orientation- need to be incorporated in a short, discrete block of time through the mentorship of primary care doctors so that student can find relevance of what they been taught to be practice in real situation. \r\nxiv. Peer-assisted learning- may be started during block posting so that weaker students can feel free to learn from their friends. \r\nxv. Evidence-based medicine- at least one day in a month is devoted during clinical years of study. \r\n\r\nVI. Incorporation of DREEM- to evaluate educational environment\r\n\r\nVII. Staff development program: \r\nOur surgery department is part of two separate independent institutions (BIRDEM and IMC) with separate goals and interests of their own apart from individual faculty. BIRDEM is intended to have clinical services, IMC expects experts teaching skills, whereas, individual faculty expects successful career plan. To fulfill such outcomes many programs are run routinely and in adhoc basis in both institutes and in the department, but none have any structured program of staff development. So, we need to prepare a staff development program with goals and priorities set to balance individual and organization’s need and faculty motivation. \r\ni. Teaching skill – we need to train our teachers with comprehensive course of medical education. \r\n• Short course- available in government institute and IMC continued to be availed. Continuing medical education, one session in each month in BIRDEM need to be continued. \r\n• Peer coaching- faculties need initiatives not to soldiering on alone when other more experienced colleagues are around and are willing to assist. \r\n• Mentoring\r\n• orientation for new faculties\r\n• Scientific ethics and good practice\r\nAbove three facilities need to be newly started.\r\nii. Administrative skill- need to be started at a standard of foundation training for government officials.\r\niii. Research skill- three day short-course is available now in BIRDEM. It may be extended to a broad base so that faculties feel comfort in clinical research and scientific write-up. \r\niv. Clinical work- we have organizational (BIRDEM), departmental, unit-based practice of case presentation, mortality-morbidity meeting, and journal club run in regular basis. Our organization allows faculty members to participate in CME, workshops, seminars, and conferences at home and abroad, provide all possible support to arrange CME, workshops and seminars. These should be continued.\r\nWe need collaboration with other institutes at home and abroad with specific skill development facility so that faculties may get advanced training in respective field of clinical practice. \r\nFaculties need to have incentive in the form of credit for promotion who participates and take leadership in above programs.  \r\nv. Career planning- for junior faculties \r\nvi. Network building – our faculties are members of society and forum of their respective discipline (national and international). This need to be continued and encouraged for further extension so that they can remain updated and get ready for future advancement through active participation. \r\n\r\nVIII. Conclusion:\r\n“A medical schools most important asset is its faculty”. Academic vitality and advance clinical practice is dependent upon faculty member’s interest and expertise. We should remain innovative and flexible to accommodate the ever-changing needs of our teachers. Our institutions and the health care system in which we work. \r\n', '2018-02-10 06:37:58', 'upload/attachment/044527ed77214375a9de133edd4d5a04.docx', '<p>Dear fellow, It is well written indeed.

Describe the process of e-learning & its role in CPD.\r\n\r\nOnline environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment –\r\nDefinition of online environment – It is an educational approach, culture context & physical setting where teaching & learning occur by using ICT (Information & communication technologies).\r\nPrinciples of e-learning – E-learning (often referred to as online learning) is not simply a broadcast of documents in electronic format to students via the internet, it encompasses a pedagogical approach that typically aspires to be flexible, engaging & learner-centered; one that encourages interaction (staff-staff, staff-student, student-student) and collaboration & communication, often asynchronously (through not exclusively so). Any course that employs e-learning might be run exclusively online or might be a mixture of online & face to face activities (Blended learning).\r\nReasons of online environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment –\r\n1. The facilitator in e-learning may take the role being guide the student to work themselves through issues instead of supplying information only may take the role of the traditional facilitator.\r\n2. E-learning is now widely used in various forms of case based or problem based learning (PBL). \r\nPBL may be e-PBL or face to face e-PBL. e-PBL can be similar to standard PBL; the case is created & then distributed through e-mail or by posting into the VLE or in a system specifically designed for ePBL. Students interact with each other via chat rooms, bulletin boards, email or white boards. Face to face e-PBL is an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n3. In blended e-learning a mixture of online & face to face activities used for learning is an extension of face to face learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Audio & video – A good way for novice e-teachers to begin using audio & video is to create sound or video files that can be placed on a website or VLE for download by students. Audio conferencing using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) or tele conferencing by using skype, video conferencing & web conferencing as live lecture are extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n5. Syndicating content & casting – Audio & video files (often referred to as vodcasting) are streamed directly into the student’s device, using a format known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n6. Chat rooms are used for synchronous communication when students are dispersed but wish to attend a discussion simultaneously. Synchronous question & answer in a chat room where student & faculty meet online  as in lecture theatre as an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n7. Discussion boards in e-learning (also known as bulletin boards or forums) are a means for participants to communicate asynchronously. This means that someone posts a message & others read & post replies at some later date or time; threads of discussion thereby build up over time as an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\n8. Blogs ( a shortened form of weblogs) in e-learning typically take the form of a personal online journal , usually written by one individual, but open to be read by all . Each new post is added on top of previous post is as an extension of face to face learning environment.\r\nDescribe the process of e-learning :\r\nAny learning experience supported by ICT often referring to as online learning. The term e-learning describes the use of the new electronic technologies including the internet to facilitate learning. It includes-\r\n• The online delivery of course content\r\n• Discussion forums\r\n• Online tutoring or mentoring\r\n• Bulletin boards\r\n• Synchronous communication & instant chat\r\n• Online assessment\r\n• Offline resources such as CDs & DVDs.\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n      Processes of e-learning includes –\r\n1. Schedules (Study guides)\r\n2. Rules\r\n3. Protocols\r\n4. Online discussion\r\n5. Chat\r\n6. Conferencing (Teleconferencing, skype, web conferencing, audio & video conferencing)\r\n7. By accessing specific e-learning content.\r\n8. By taking tests & assessments (Formative & summative e-assessment)\r\n9. Working through short exercise to stimulate thinking.\r\n10.

Describe the process of e-learning and its role in CPD”\r\nFellow ID: 181020\r\nThe world of education has been varied by the fast and rapid revolution in computer and the Internet technologies. The arrival of World Wide Web (WWW) has increased the demand for distance education and concepts like online learning or e- learning has emerged, as a result. \r\nIn the online learning environment, teaching and learning take place through the use of computers, internet and computer mediated digital systems. It is also called the e-learning environment \r\ne-learning might be exclusively online or might be a mixture of online and face to face activities, called blended learning .\r\n\r\nOnline environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment because-\r\n• In face to face learning, there is facilitator.  Online environments also allow students to take turns as a moderator or facilitator and learn much more from the process. Online facilitation uses bulletin boards or chat rooms as the point of contact between students and facilitators.\r\n• All forms of group work requires participation. In face to face learning, this participation occurs physically in classroom, campus and in online environment they collaborate with others by reading, responding and posting messages via e-mail, chat room, and/or whiteboard\r\n• In online learning learners get to know about the course content and exam schedules by reading course module notes, e-mail messages and postings to discussion area.\r\n• In a classroom setting, the instructor may often pose a question. In many cases, the question leads to a serious discussion and debate with other students. This also occurs in the online classroom through the use of discussion topics in the discussion area by audio, video and web conferencing by the use of skype, MSN . \r\n• In online learning, e-assessment is taken by the use of ICT for authoring, delivering, marking, providing feedback and analyzing of both formative and summative student assessment.\r\n• In a classroom setting, classmates typically meet before or after class for a cup of coffee and a bit of socializing. This can still occur in the online environment using e-mail, the discussion area or chat rooms. Everyone likes know a bit about the people they are studying with.\r\n• There are also e-Logistics and e- administration which support the administration and logistics of learning environment\r\nMany of the principles of face to face teaching and learning also apply to online learning environment. Many technological tools and different social media devices  minimize the distance between students and to make online classes as interesting as face-to-face ones.\r\nAs seen, e-learning can be as great as the face-to face learning environment. These facts show that students will be more benefited from online classes if the course is a blend of online and face- to face learning, then one can easily emphasise that “Online environment is merely an extension of face to face learning environment”.\r\nProcess of e-learning:\r\nThe process of e-learning begins with a comprehensive analysis of learners, learning content, and context and ends with performing a quality check. The e-learning process includes several stages: analysis, planning, design, development, delivery, and evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\ne-learning process can be divided into two major phases:\r\n1) Content preparation\r\n2) Content implementation \r\nContent preparation\r\nContent preparation phase consists of activities including analysis, planning, design, development and evaluation.\r\nIn analysis stage learning goals and objectives are established and learner’s knowledge and skills are identified. It is a broad process.\r\nOn the basis of analysis stage, a comprehensive e- learning plan can be developed and it serves as road map.\r\nThe design of e- learning follows a logical and orderly method of organizing course contents with learning objectives, relevant learning strategies, assessment instruments, exercise and delivery media.\r\nContent implementation \r\nDuring the implementation phase all e-content is distributed to or is accessible by its stakeholder groups at anytime from anywhere in the world. In this phase, all e-learning content is uploaded to the server (usually all e-content is hosted on LMSs - Learning Management Systems or LCMSs). \r\nAll supplemental course materials (e.g., CD, DVD, audio and video cassette, book, course pack, etc.) are also delivered to its stakeholder groups. Before offering an e-learning course to its target population, an institution should have an efficient administrative system to register students, experienced technical support system to maintain and update e-learning content. \r\nInstitution should have a procedure for training instructors and facilitators on course curriculum, learning outcomes, method of delivery, and testing procedures. Similar procedures should be in place for technical and other support staff and students.\r\nInstitution must employ a system of updating and monitoring of all e-learning materials on a regular basis. During this stage it is critical that all internal and external links and resources are active, and all security measures are in place.\r\nRole of e-learning in CPD-\r\nContinuing professional development (CPD) involves not only educational activities to enhance medical competence in medical knowledge and skills, but also in management, team building, professionalism, interpersonal communication, technology, teaching, and accountability.\r\nIt is an ongoing process and continues throughout a professional’s career. \r\nThe traditional method of CPD are face -to- face courses, seminars or it may be informal, such as reading of journals and texts, which are not always possible. Traditional CPD include family commitments, lack of time, distances to travel and increased work load. e-learning can play very important role to overcome these barriers. \r\n e-learning-\r\n• Provides online courses on CPD\r\n• Makes the course convenient \r\n• Makes the course schedule and environment flexible \r\n• Makes the course relevant\r\n• Provides individual, independent learning approach\r\n• Provides systematic learning approach\r\n• Provides opportunity of self assessment and feedback\r\n• Save time for other professional and personal activities\r\n• Maintains privacy and confidentiality of the learner\r\nTraditional method along with e-learning can make the CPD successful. Every doctor has a personal responsibility to participate in continuing professional development. Institutions should accept responsibility for both CME and CPD of doctors, establish effective CPD schemes and strategies to meet the needs of doctors, the populations they serve, and the organizations where they work.                                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-02-14 04:07:24', 'upload/attachment/1f60cb9553be2b571a0e4357fe2414c9.doc', '<p>Dear fellow</p><p>Your assignment accepted.

It has many pros and cons. Online (OL) learning is a new system of teaching learning first introduced in 2002 and rapidly gaining acceptance. It has many advantages over traditional learning, but not also without limitations. Blending system including both traditional and online are complementary and provide maximum benefits to the learners. When considered together online learning environment provide support as an extension of service that is provided by face-to-face (FtF) learning environment. There are many causes as mentioned below:\r\n1. Traditional learning environment provide age oriented learning opportunity from primary school through to university level. There are little or no scope of on-campus learning facility for elderly people who feel to keep learning out of boredom or curiosity. OL learning environment provides various courses for them.\r\n2. Not all students can avail facility of traditional learning because of medical condition or disability. They can avail OL courses for study. \r\n3. Some learners need school transfer due to change of locations of parents’ job. They can avail OL learning to continue with the same school from their new location. \r\n4. Those who are doing job, continue learning OL with same academic calendar as their institutions that provide courses. They can take classes at their time they wish. \r\n5. Traditional learning provides much life experiences and OL also provides experience from discussion forum, synchronous communication and instant chat.\r\n6. FtF learning provides more value to college degree, allow to meet service providers who hires alumni from college, whereas, OL provide with special service oriented skills which also help to get job. FtF allows access to equipment and facilities to improve knowledge about a subject in a campus. OL focus on improving skill and make marketable leading to polished and development of job related skills. \r\n7. FtF give general critical thinking skill but may not get hands on experience of what you learn. Thus get tough to do a task in professional life, whereas, OL helps in such situation with relevant skills about subject. \r\n8. FtF is expensive, OL cuts off expenditure to a half and thus allows learners to continue study. \r\n9. Those engaged in FtF and travel extensively need not interruption of study if OL facilities are available in his institutes.\r\n10. In FtF tutors are available to interact to teach to assess and to provide feedback and in OL learners can contact tutors when needed instantly, also has the opportunity of self-assessment.\r\n11. FtF learning is directed by teachers/supervisors/guides and learners become self-dependent, self-regulated and self-directed in OL environment. \r\nThus where FtF stops/limits its service OL environment continue with the learners to solve the limitations. \r\nAssignment-2\r\nDescribe the Process of E-learning (EL) and its Role in Continuing Professional Development (CPD)\r\nThere are some common phases that any EL development process must undergo. There are a fair number of instructional design modules. Whatever module is chosen, the module itself is followed quite rigidly. In EL each organization follows its own process that fits into its way of functioning. There are some common faces that are followed. These are:\r\n1. Creation of instructional design (IDD)- This is a high level plan of overall instructional approaches of the course. Some approaches are problem-solving, avatars and scenarios. It is also decided how the content need to be broken down to courses, modules and scenarios. Each course is to be created using a different IDD strategy, dealt with in the IDD. Instructional and visual elements are finalized.\r\n2. Scripting- Contents of each course is broadly finalized and divided into modules and the content for each screen within each module is decided on. Interactivities, assessment, activities and resources for each module are finalized. Narrative script is finalized. Form of script may be word document of power-point presentations.\r\n3. Development of a prototype- This is a complete representation of entire course in a few slides. On screen content and audio scripts are created and finalized. Important elements are picked up for the course and a functional prototype is created. Final decision is made about how contents will be presented on screen, interactivities, activities/assignments added, colors, images, animations and additional resources provided. The prototype needs to be functional on the learning management system.\r\n4. Development of the course without audio- Fully functional course is made ready and approved without audio. May need changes in content, narration, and animation etc. before approval. \r\n5. Development of the course audio- Audio script is finalized, synchronized with animations and on screen text and fully functioning course with audio is ready. \r\n6. Creation of learning management system version- This is the final step is mostly mechanical and technical one. Once get the final approval the course is ready to be hosted on the learning platform and go “live”. Technical take care at this stage. \r\nEach face of the process of EL development need approval before going to the next step. Thus at the end of the day a successful course is created and learners get a course that helps them learn. \r\nRole of EL in CPD\r\nEL has the potential in the delivery of CPD services online. Professionals are time constrained and price sensitive, naturally strong independent learners making them good candidates for EL services. \r\n1. EL provides customized or personalized curriculum that is needed by individual students. \r\n2. Learning is made available at a time and place that is optimal for the learner.\r\n3. Provide access to teachers and resources from any place at any time world-wide.\r\n4. Learners work together more closely and more meaningfully.\r\n5. Access to interactive content.\r\n6. Access to simulations, ability to rehearse scenarios and procedures thus accelerate expertise.\r\nThe followings are the primary service components for OL CPD:\r\n1. Personal development planner\r\n2. CPD port folio tracker\r\n3. EL course delivery\r\n4. Supporting resource banks \r\n\r\n', '2018-02-13 01:00:11', 'upload/attachment/c77c66f6d25086ce85123bc0a5d30d65.docx', '<p>welldone</p>', NULL, '2018-02-13 07:00:11', 'F'),

(136, 106, 'Title: Differentiating teaching from instruction using suitable examples. Prepare an instructional text for your students of your own discipline following the rules of instructional design theory', 'Introduction\r\nInstruction is a human activity and its purpose is to help people learn. Instruction is a set of events which affect learner in such a way that learning is ultimately facilitated like enzyme acts as biocatalyst. The conception of teaching is not about transmitting information or imparting knowledge but about facilitating student learning. Instruction may be a printed page, picture, television program or combination of any physical objects. Teaching although consider as one form of instruction but it is the single most important one among all other instructions. A handout on contents in topic “UTI” may be supplied to students containing reading lists including definition, aetiology, clinical features, investigations and treatment, which is an instruction and a later taken lecture class (teaching learning session) on UTI may be an example of teaching.\r\nSo, Instruction is a broad heading under which teaching is a form of instruction which facilitates learning.\r\n                                                                     My instructional text on UTI \r\nInstructional design theories concerned with arranging external events that support internal process of the learner to achieve learning outcome .Every teacher should have specific and detailed knowledge of the intent and purpose of each of the instructional events. There are several instructional design theories of these; Robert Gagne proposed a series of events which follow a systematic instructional design process that share the behaviorist approach to learning with a focus on the outcome of instruction or training\r\nThe following nine steps have been adapted from Gagne, Briggs, and Wager (1992)\r\n1. Gaining attention: The purpose of this event is to focus learners on the tasks to be learned by presenting an interesting event, telling a relevant story or showing a picture. It is important to remember that attention must be maintained throughout the session for effective learning\r\n2. Inform the learning objective- it is important because the learners need to know what they are to learn and to achieve\r\nObjective-\r\na. Definition of UTI\r\nb.  common organisms causing UTI\r\nc. Pathophysiology\r\nd. Diagnosis\r\ne. Management and\r\nf. Follow up\r\n3. Stimulate recall of prior learning- help students make sense of new information by relating it to something they already know or something they have already experienced.\r\nMethods for stimulating recall include:\r\n Have you seen the patient of UTI?\r\n Ask few common questions like why female are more prone to UTI? \r\n What is the most common organism?\r\n4. Present the content- it is considered as the core of teaching. In this event, the fact, the concept and principles of learning to be focused in a structured way so, that learner can understand. Same content of instruction of multiple version provide added facilitation e.g. video, demonstration. In sometime use a variety of media to address different learning preferences.\r\n5. Provide learning guidance- advice students of strategies to aid them in learning content and of                        resources available.\r\n Methods to provide learning guidance include: \r\n-Provide instructional support as needed-as scaffold (cues, hints, prompt) which can be    removed after they learn the task or content.\r\n-Model varied learning strategies-mnemonics, concept mapping, role playing\r\n-Use examples and non-examples\r\n6. Elicit performance (practice) – this event provides the occasion for learners to practice or checks that the students have learned\r\n Ways to activate learner processing include: \r\n-Elicit student activities - palpate the lower abdomen, elicit renal angle whether tender or not \r\n-Elicit recall strategies-ask them to recite, revisit or reiterate information they have learned\r\n- Help them integrate new knowledge\r\n7. Providing feedback on performance-feedback for student very much essential for learning. It help student for assessing performance as well as facilitate learning. There are different type of feedback\r\n-Confirmatory feedback-Inform the student they did what he/she were suppose to do.\r\n-Corrective and remedial feedback- Inform the student the accuracy of their performance     or response\r\n-Remedial feedback-Directs students in the right direction to find the correct answer but does not provide the correct answer\r\n-Informative feedback-Provides information (New, different, addition or suggestions) for listening as well as sharing between them\r\n-Analytical feedback- provide the student with suggestions, recommendations and information for them to correct their performance\r\n8. Assessing the performance-is concerned with complete demonstration of learning outcomes at the end of instruction. It conform that the learning has taken place. For expected complete learning we must test to see improvement  \r\nMethods for testing learning include:  \r\n -Conduct a post test to check for mastery of content or skills\r\n-Include objective or criterion-referenced performances which measure how well a student has    learned a topic\r\n-Identify a normative-referenced performance which compares one student to another student\r\n9. Enhance retention and transfer to job- to help learners develop expertise, they must internalize new knowledge  \r\nConclusion: Ganges nine event of instruction can help build the framework with which to prepare and deliver instructional content. Ideally we should prepare course goals and learning objectives before implementing the nine events. The nine events of instruction can then be modified to fit both the content to be presented and student’s level of knowledge.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n', '2018-02-22 07:31:59', 'upload/attachment/435f3f4ad91496e96ae0a6d500ee9ce6.docx', '<p>Your overall writing is very good but if you write instructional text for your student, following the style I have attached here would be even better.

(137, 96, 'Instructional text for the topic" Bipolar Mood Disorder" following the rules of Gagne''s Nine Events of Instruction', 'Emphasis in medical education should be firmly on how students can apply their knowledge in solving problems that is on what they can do rather than what they know so the thrust of teaching is to be on facilitating learning rather than on covering the subject. But, as Light & Cox (2001) point out, teachers have a responsibility which takes them beyond facilitating the “construction” of knowledge to assisting and supporting the student to develop as persons. In achieving this, the process of instructional design is significant. \r\nTeaching almost always implies having a teacher. Instruction can come from a piece of paper or a book. Teaching is more complex in nature. When we talk about teaching, we are dealing with different techniques, strategies, and approaches that will facilitate learning. Teachers have to come up with varied instructional materials and must use the right strategies in teaching their lessons. \r\nTeaching is also a never ending process. By the time individuals start going to school to the time they graduate and start working, they''re involved in the teaching-learning process. They don''t only learn from teachers but also from those around them. \r\nThis makes teaching both formal and informal. It is formal when it occurs inside the classroom or informal when you learn things outside the portals of the school. For instance, we learn to read and write in school with the help of your teachers. On the other hand, our parents teach us informally about living life and correct values. \r\nWhen we talk about instruction, it''s not as complex as teaching. Instruction is simply giving direction. We instruct someone on what to do and how to do it. For instance, in school we''re given instructions by our teachers on how to answer a test or how to perform an experiment. After which, we''re simply left to do our work on our own. \r\nInstruction makes learners dependent on the teacher. We''re told what to do and oftentimes, there are steps we need to follow. Instructions must be understood and followed strictly in order to accomplish a particular task. Once we fail to do so, we won''t be able to finish the task correctly. \r\nTeaching and instruction go together especially in education. Both are needed in helping people learn and develop as individuals.\r\nInstructional text for students (Bipolar mood disorder)\r\n1. Gaining attention of the student\r\nShow a video of a manic patient\r\nPresenting some alarming facts, like\r\n    Mortality is about twice in bipolar patients\r\n    Rates of suicide 15 times higher in bipolar even higher in depression\r\n2. Informing students about the objectives/ learning outcomes-\r\n   The video shows that the patient is difficult to handle by the attendant and the facts shows that there is risk if untreated, so \r\n            I)We have to learn- (Cognitive domain)\r\nDefinition\r\nEpidemiology\r\nEtiology\r\nClinical features\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nManagement\r\nPrognosis of Bipolar mood disorder\r\nii) We have to acquire the skill of interviewing and managing the patient practically (Psychomotor domain)\r\niii) We have to realize the problems of the attendants and showing empathy to them and give some advices needed accordingly (Affective domain)\r\n\r\n3. Stimulating recall of prior learning-\r\n     Asking about previous concept of - mood, depression, hallucination, delusions, mood stabilizer and other psychotropic drugs, mental state examination etc.\r\n4. Presenting the content-\r\n    Organize and chunk content in a meaningful way. Provide explanations after demonstration. Give examples. Asking questions and giving clues to answer.\r\n5. Providing learning guidance-\r\n     Group work/ Psychodrama/Role play (Mental state examination of a Manic patient) & Case studies to discuss contents.\r\n6. Eliciting performance-\r\n      To elicit recall, asking students to recite/revisit information after Role play\r\n7. Providing feedback\r\n            Inform the students about accuracy of their performance of interviewing a patient of Bipolar mood disorder in role play and provide the student with suggestions, recommendations, and information for them to correct their performance \r\n8. Assess performance\r\n      By embedding questions throughout instruction through oral questioning and or quizzes\r\n9. Enhance retention and transfer to the job-\r\n       Summarize the topic and provide additional resources to help student internalize new knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe must have appropriate media as tool and alternate arrangement in case of emergency if it does not support the class. There should be a non-threatening environment in the class. Teachers must include new attempts to keep the lesion interesting for the students, and change the lesion plan accordingly in every lecture.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nReferences-\r\n\r\n1. https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20121005042739AAR94Cp\r\n2.

Prepare an instructional text for your students following the rules of instructional design theory (your own discipline).\r\n\r\nTeaching is the process of attending to people''s needs, experiences and feelings, and making specific interventions to help them learn particular things. It is the imparting of knowledge by a teacher or other knowledgeable person.\r\nInstruction is vital for education, as it is the transfer of learning from one person to another. Any time we are given directions or told how to do something we are receiving instruction.\r\nThe noun instruction is related to the word structure. Effective instruction is presented in an orderly, structured manner.\r\nTeaching and learning usually involve instruction. Teachers have to come up with varied instructional materials and must use the right strategies in teaching their lessons. \r\n\r\n         Differentiation between teaching and instruction are given below:\r\n We can teach almost anything: concepts, ideas, theories but when we instruct someone, we are giving them a set of tools or tasks to do something specific.\r\n Teaching works for overall development while specific instruction works for specific domain development. \r\nFor example-\r\n In heat coagulation test, the instructions are-\r\n• Objective- it is done to detect protein in urine\r\n• Materials and method\r\n• Comments\r\nBut from the point of view of teaching, we can say many things about heat coagulation test other than instruction. Suppose, we can define and classify proteinuria, mention other methods of detection of protein in urine, explain the changes happen to protein after heat coagulation test and many more things.\r\n Teaching is bi-directional but instruction is uni-directional. For example, teachers form their lesson plan on a topic according to instruction but when they apply this lesson plan in class it becomes teaching and they get learner’s response\r\n Teaching is more complex in nature. When we talk about teaching, we are dealing with different techniques, strategies, and approaches that will facilitate learning. \r\nInstruction, is not as complex as teaching. Instruction makes the teaching easy. Instruction is simply giving direction. We instruct someone on what to do and how to do it. \r\nFor instance, in medical college students are given instructions by their teachers on how to answer a test or how to perform an experiment. \r\n Teaching is also a never ending process. We don''t only learn from teachers but also from those around us. This makes teaching both formal and informal. It is formal when it occurs inside the classroom or informal when you learn things outside the portals of the educational institute.\r\nIn educational environment, Instruction is always formal and given by the teacher or facilitator by various ways like lecture notes, handouts, power point, overhead projector etc.\r\nIn teaching, Instructions must be understood and followed strictly in order to accomplish a particular task. Once we fail to do so, we won''t be able to finish the task correctly. \r\nTeaching and instruction go together especially in education. Both are needed in helping people learn and develop as individual.\r\n\r\nI am from Biochemistry discipline and my instructional text for my students following the rules of instructional design theory are given below:\r\n\r\nTopic: Concept of Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrate\r\nIntroduction:\r\nGain attention \r\nTo gain attention, I raise questions like,\r\n To get energy what we intake? (We intake carbohydrate. It is ingested in complex form) \r\n  Can they tell the name of the process that makes this complex carbohydrate in simpler form after ingestion and make it suitable for absorption? (It is digestion)\r\nInform the learning objectives\r\nAt the end of the session the students will be able to:\r\n1. Name the dietary carbohydrates\r\n2. State the names and sources of enzymes of carbohydrate digestion\r\n3. Describe the steps of carbohydrate digestion with the name of end products\r\n4. Enumerate the Process of carbohydrate absorption\r\n\r\nStimulating recall pre-requisite knowledge\r\nIn their undergraduate level and from my previous lectures students have already known about the carbohydrate. So, I ask them-\r\n Can they name the dietary carbohydrates?\r\n What types of carbohydrates they are?\r\n Can they say from where carbohydrate digestion starts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContent\r\n\r\nPresent new content\r\n1. Mention the main dietary carbohydrates\r\n2. Name the enzymes that are required for carbohydrate digestion\r\n3.

Introduction:\r\nLearning is facilitated by teaching. The teacher has to communicate with learners for effective teaching. Instruction acts as a means of communication among teacher and learners in a systematic way. \r\n\r\n2. Teaching:\r\nTeaching may be defined as an organized communication between the teachers and the students, concerned with providing students with opportunities to learn. It encompasses course design, course management and methods of teaching, provision of other learning opportunities, assessment and feedback of students. It is an intentional activity and interactive process among teacher, student and tasks. \r\nTeacher’s concept of teaching vary greatly, some are happy to ‘covering the subject’, others claim that they are ‘imparting information’ and still others are ‘imparting knowledge’. They emphasis on the content of the subject and their teaching of it. This type of teaching is ‘teachers-centered’ and content oriented. In this process, the student will get a sufficient grasp of the subject to be able to answer the questions raised in an examinations in the form of recall of factual information. Here learning is often thought as a single uniform process, there are little or no distinction made between “learning to load a rifle and learning to solve a complex mathematical problem”. \r\nThis trend is changing, now there are teachers who are facilitating student learning, adopt an approach to teaching that is “student-centered and learning oriented”. \r\n\r\n3. Instruction:\r\nFor effective teaching, the teacher has to communicate with the learners. Instructional materials act as means of communicating ideas from the teacher to the learners, thus help to achieve learning goals. Instructional design can be considered as a process through which teacher can identify the nature of the learning that is intended to take place, work out an approach to teaching that will facilitate the achievement of that learning and administer an appropriate assessment that will determine whether the intended learning has taken place. Instructions may be defined as “the set of plannred external events which influence the process of learning and thus promote learning” (Robert Gangne). In this process the student is encourage to adopt “deep approach” to learning and its expected to understand and apply the knowledge acquired. \r\nThe steps of the instruction include need assessment, objective, medium, implementation and evaluation. There is an interaction among the components of instruction- learner characteristics, objective, methods, and evaluation. Revision of evaluation guide to review or set new objectives and nature of instruction. There are various theories of instruction which are concerned with arranging external events that supports internal process of learning to achieve learning outcome on the basis of understanding of how students learn. These theories provide guidelines for organizing the activities teachers should do (external to mind) that influence on inside the learner’s mind (internal to mind), so that they can learn easily. Thus teaching-learning is made more structured and effective to achieve the learning objectives. \r\n\r\n4. Example\r\nA teacher prepare a power point presentation in his laptop on the topic ‘Acute Appendicitis’ including introduction, anatomy (with microscopy), acute appendicitis, etiology, pathology, clinical diagnosis (history, symptoms, clinical signs), differential diagnosis (according to age), investigation, treatment, appendisectomies and their consequences with management. He used multimedia to deliver the lecture in the class using that power point presentation, provided necessary explanation, showed relevant pictures and video clips, asked questions to assess students’ understanding and retention. \r\nAn instructor provided instructions on ‘Acute Appendicitis’. He gained attention of the students by saying the story of Appendicitis of one of his friend when he was college student, then he informed the learning objectives of acute appendicitis, initiated discussions by asking questions to assess pre-requisite knowledge like ‘what are the different anatomical positions of the appendix’, then proceed to the topic ‘Appendicitis’, provided guidelines, allowed group discussions, showed diagnostic physical examinations and asked students to practice, provided feedback on examination and assessed their performances. Finally he summarized the whole topic and concluded with the advice to go through some books. \r\n\r\n5. Conclusion:\r\nThe purpose of teaching is to facilitate learning. The instructional design process is a valuable and comprehensive aid in this task since it involves the identification of nature of learning that is intended to take place. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssignment-2\r\nPrepare an Instructional Text for Your Students following the Rules of Instructional Design Theory\r\n\r\nTitle:\r\nEliciting rebound tenderness in a patient with acute appendicitis.\r\n1. Gaining attention- by showing a video clip of examination of a patient with acute appendicitis\r\n2. Informing the learning objectives\r\nAt the end of the session, students will be able to:\r\n• Show the steps of eliciting rebound tenderness \r\n3. Stimulating pre-requisite knowledge\r\nInitiate discussion by asking questions about anatomy of the appendix, acute appendicitis, etiology, pathology, clinical diagnosis, special features according to the position of the appendix, age of the patient and pregnancy state, differential diagnosis etc. \r\n4. Presenting stimulus material\r\n• List the pre-requisites of physical examination\r\n Greeting\r\n Introduce yourself to the patient\r\n Seek permission for examination\r\n Arrange for privacy\r\n Arrange for good lighting\r\n Positioning of the patient (supine)\r\n Exposure of the part to be examined (mid-chest to mid-thigh)\r\n Warming your hands\r\n• Explain the steps of eliciting rebound tenderness \r\n Ask the patient to relax his abdomen by slow, deep breathing. \r\n Apply gentle but firm pressure over the Mc. Burney’s point with the flat of your right hand standing on the right side of the patient keeping eyes towards the face of the patient.  \r\n Suddenly release the pressure off and observe patient’s facial expression of sharp pain as the hand is removed. \r\n• Show the examination by yourself\r\n• Thanks the patient for cooperation \r\n5. Providing learning guidance\r\nGive a checklist to the patient which covers the above criteria. \r\n6. Eliciting the performance\r\nGive opportunity to the learners to practice \r\n7. Provide feedback on performance to confirm the accuracy of the performance and suggest how to improve\r\n8. Assessing the performance\r\n• Ask the students to demonstrate the rebound tenderness \r\n9. Enhancing retention and transfer\r\n• Summarize the session\r\n• Ask learners to practice on dummy patients\r\n• Ask to review the video clip \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2018-02-23 16:18:39', 'upload/attachment/097b6de75b8d0891c01a6dbaf43f66b0.docx', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
